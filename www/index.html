<p>Calamity Jane Express (R) (:CJE) webversion 0.2- v0.2&#945;  06-05-2013 By Dee Jay Alexander. Released under GPL2+ license at http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</p> 
<p>This 0.2-alpha Webversion Is For Testing And Development Purposes ONLY. DONT'T use it in a real situation, because it DEFINITELY needs improvement. It has no built-in communication as of yet, but it's future versions should be able to work with existing and next-generation communications facilities.</p>
ATTENTION1: Do NOT DOWNLOAD this software from other well-known Download-sites, UNLESS the offered software there has been upgraded to this version, since it's predecessor is an OLD one and thus VERY OUTDATED.<br />
ATTENTION2: You should experience an accordion weblayout here. Not all browsers show things right. Best experience on a smartphone (SGS2 Android 2.3.6), incl watching CJE + mp4 videos, was with Dolphin Mobile 9.3.2+ plus Androids own Videos-player, other browsers sometimes showed erratic behavior especially during dragging in combination with scrolling, but that will probably improve into the future. On a desktop where the browsers might be shrinked to smartphone size to get the experience, tthe latest Chrome, Firefox and Opera browsers should do well. No experience with other browsers.<br />

<h3>Short intro (part1/2)</h3>
<div>
<p>
When a (potential) disaster is about to strike, the affected area and people in it might, for whatever reason, be completely beyond the reach and/or capacity of emergency workers from private and/or governmental organizations.<br /><br />

Studies however, showes that people are definitely not helpless or panicky run around like "chicken little" at forehand. on the contrary, when some disaster is about to happen, is happening or has just happened, people often take actions to help themselves and each other, long before profesional emergency workers enter the scene, if ever.<br /><br />

What the people often lack, is a good informationsystem among themselves that is able to inform them of possible threats, needs and resources/help, independent of the default informationsystem.<br />
All too often, because of the disaster, the default informationsystem is either seriously jammed or has even blacked out completely.<br />
Thereby, disasters may strike all of a sudden, either on a personal or on community level.<br /><br />

Fortunately, many people already carry a potentially powerfull hardware informationsystem around with them 24/7: the high-end smartphone, that nowadays and certainly in the future more and more resembles the power and capacity of that of a desktop computer, but also offers extra built-in communication facilities.<br /><br />

In some (potential) emergency we often have to deal with all kinds of hit-and-run situations that need immidiate attention and actions.<br /><br /> 

The "calamity jane express(r)" framework now, is just to be made for emergency situations where most often threats, chaos and scarcity rules. this (to be built) hit-and-run peer-to-peer framework is to offer data and even functionality on the fly (:fotf).<br /><br />

It's building blocks actually are based on existing open standards and proven technology, just rearanged a bit. all involved (end-user) devices are off-the-shelf hardware and have a web-based softwaresystem, a default on-board personal proxy server and a so-called bulleted-user-interface or "bui".<br /><br />

- Off-the-shelf hardware means that no special (read scarce and/or expensive) technology is needed.<br />
- A web-based software-system means that one is no longer dependent on a specific operating system, just a w3-compliant browser suffices.<br />
- A default on-board personal proxy server means that one can make use of sophisticated server-side frameworks with sophisticated processing, storage and server-based peer-to-peer communication.<br /><br />

-The newly (and to be further developed) bulleted-user-interface or "bui" now offers this device's sophisticated capabilities as simple, uniform and freely relocatable "bullets" to the user. these "bullets can represent anything, data or functionality, can come from anywhere, local or remote, and can easily be grouped, mixed, duplicated and related with each other in any way at any time and may work on a common canvas (if allowed so by the user). in other words, data and functions are no longer locked in some file or application at forehand, but are composed on the fly from a collection of "omni-present nodes" into a "web of data and functionality" (:wodaf).<br /><br />

Just as it is needed in an (potential) emergency situation, although this framework can also be used in non-emergency situations, but then it offers huge agility, versatility, customization and scalability compared to existing legacy frameworks.<br /><br />

Calamity Jane Express(R) ONLINE Webversion 0.2&#945;  06-05-2013 Online TEST-Version </a>(JQUERY scripts hosted at JQuery and Google); ATTENTION: the online version, for some reason, might respond rather slow, since it's actually not meant for remote but local (on-board of your device) use. The installable DEVELOPERS version should give good response (on Samsung GS2 Android 2.3.6 w/Dolphin mobile browser 9.4.1)</p>

<h3>How to test plus some tips.</h3>
<div>
<p>This software has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S2  GT-I9100 international version. Android version: 2.3.6 Gingerbread. It must be said that the best mobile browsing results came from an "outsider": Dolphin Browser mobile version 9.4.1 (www.dolphin.com). The "established" mobile browsers sometimes showed unpredicted behaviour. Well, let's blame it on this still inmature CJE-software. Users should try out for themselves which browsers might give the best results.</p>
<p>When using the online Webversion you will be able to do all kind of manipulations, including temporarely saving it into your internal memory but excluding creating bullets (items) and saving things onto your disk.</p>
<p>If you want this then you need the DEVELOPERS version (Linux only, but to be ported to Windows, Mac etc) and should have a (software) server installed</p>
<p>TIP1: Do NOT use the browsers Backpage-key or you might mess up CJE's internal history-track. Use CJE's own Backward- and Forward-button on the footer of the page instead (should be taken care off in next versions). You might use function-key F11 "Full Screen" to avoid accidently pressing the browsers Backpage-button.</p>
<p>TIP2: Actually this software-version is developed for a smartphone screensize, although the idea itself of a "bulleted-user-interface" or "bui" is also excellent for desktop screensize and larger. If you use desktop screensize, you might simulate the smartphone-view by just shrinking the browser to smartphone size.</p>
<p>TIP3: Remember that many suggestions mentioned here are "functionality-to-be", i.e. they might not be implemented as of yet. So do NOT expect the world of it, because we're just scratching the surface!</p>

<p>On the Web there will be only 1 app, the browser, the rest is added/wasted functionality by way of "catching and disposing bullets on the fly".</p>
<p>TIP: press F11 after opening image.</p>

<h3>What is the origin of the "Calamity Jane Express(R)" project?</h3>
<div>
<p>The predicted year 2000 catastrophe, which happened to be a non-event, was at the start of the CJE project.<br />
Nevertheless, instead of quiting things alltogether, I continued Internet search and homebrew research/development concerning calamities and technologies to counter such situations, more or less until today. So it was a 13-years period of surfing from (open) standards to standards, from technologies to technologies, from ideas and initiatives to ideas and initiatives to find the combination that might be right fit for the job. It indeed took some time...<br />
Certain conclusions of disaster reports also found their way into this project. One of their main conclusions was that people not just wait for help and/or run around like Chicken Little. As soon as people find out that a disaster of some kind happened or is likely to happen, they take or at least try to take the appropriate actions themselves. So, instead of often being considered as a part of the problem by many governments, they actually should be considered as a (potential) part of the solution by the same governments! Because with the right information and skills they are able to do much more than most governments think. Other reports mention the need for a communications system for the common people to help themselves and each other. 
</p>
</div>

<h3>Is this where "Calamity Jane Express(R)" kicks in?</h3>
<div>
<p>Actually... yes! It should make it possible to quickly find the emergency information people are looking for, and to communicate with each other and the rest of the world.<br />
The intention of the CJE-Framework is:<br /> 
1. An intelligent device based system that has enough "software-power" so that it can take care of itself and also provide its owner as much as possible of emergency related information (text, images, video, audio) so they can help themselves and theirs (people, pets and properties) when completely cut off from any networks.<br />
2. To be able to quickly setup a local web-based p2p ad-hoc mesh network in case of an emergency when communication utilities black out. From here people can set up a community to record the threats, needs and resources and make use of that information to help themselves and each other. This network should also be able to (automatically) seek for contact with the outside world and exchange information with it, especially with governments. <br />
CJE has as its base with the common people with their smartphone. The smartphone herein is no longer regarded as just a "toything" but upgraded to the next generation pc: pc/2, pc version 2 or just pc2, to distinguish it from the legacy PC. The CJE-Framework stands for maximum opportunism and promiscuity: it can "eat" anything and can work together side by side with legacy technology (you only need a browser and an on-board server on some operating system).<br />
There are already several open standards, technologies, ideas and initiatives to accomplish this. This project welcomes all of this and tries to find out how things might work together. </p>

<h3>Why the name "Calamity Jane Express(R)"?</h3>
<div>
<p>Calamity Jane was a famous an adventurous woman who lived in the Wild West of the 19th century and who knew well how to handle a rifle. In a certain period of her live she was also a post-woman for the US army. It is from this episode that the name "Calamity Jane Express(R)" was derived.</p>
</div>

<h3>Just another basic idea behind the Calamity Jane Express(R) project.</h3>
<div>
<p>Calamity Jane Express(R) stands for maximal opportunism and promiscuity: make use of ANY opportunity and be able to work with ANYTHING to get out of some threatening situation. The digital framework must reflect this idea. One result of this is that it must be tech-neutral: any technology suffices, as long as it complies with the underlying (open) emergency standards.</p>
