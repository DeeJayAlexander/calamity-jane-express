<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>
<p>Hereby I would like to present a project called "Calamity Jane Express(R)" that exists since 1999 and was originally created to only develop emergency related software. Recently however, this project has outstretched into the (initial) development of a new to be developed Web-based framework, with mobile computing at it's very center, and (the very start of) a new web-based user-interface that is extremely versatile, scalable and customizable. In this project the highend smartphone, here upgraded to PC2(1), is considered the future most personal computing device, where all other computing devices sooner or later, more or less are to become peripheral to it.<br />
This PC2 should be considered a sophisticated part of the new Web-based framework, because it default has it's own personal proxy server on-board and server-side frameworks are very sophisticated these days. All communication with its inner filesystem AND with the outside world goes via this onboard server. The browser's main responsibility is now conentrated on "looking good" and "behaving well" to the maximum convenience of the user.<br />
The newly to developed user-interface is a so called "bulleted-user-interface" or "bui", with at it's core the freely relocatable list-item (but it can be locked in-place if needed) that has the visual shape of a kind-of-bullet and is called as such. The crucial thing here is that these uniform-shaped "bullets" can represent any kind of (passive) data and/or (executable) functions and can come from anywhere at any time and can perform actions on a common canvas when needed/allowed. This means that functionality no longer is locked in a specific app on a specific operating system on a specific device, but can be seperately addressed and activated from (in essence) all over the place. Also when looking for specific data, one doesn't have to open up the whole file, but software can extract the datapiece that is needed. This adds to high granularity and all these functions and data(pieces) can be considered nodes; NODAF: Nodes Of Data And Functions. Since the "bullet's" structure is universal, they can also be related to each other in ANY way in some kind of web, WODAF: Web Of Data And Functions (:"Lord of the Web"?:-) This way you can consider the Web not only as a giant datasource, but also as a giant processor where functionality can be grabbed on-the-fly: everyone now composes his/her own web-enabled app (:wepp).<br />
In the ultimate situation, this way the end-user can thus freely relocate, group, mix and relate data with functions whether from his/her own device or from the Web and he/she wouldn't be able to tell the difference! In other words: the user can create his/her own functionality, on the fly! This "bui" is also highly scalable: it works conveniently from wrist- to projector-size screens.<br />
Just to give an initial impression of how things might work, a small web-enabled app (:wepp) has been created(2) and can be downloaded from www.calamityjaneexpress.net.
So if you think:<br />
1. you get somehow a (practical) idea of the concept<br />
2. you like the idea, but you are sure it DEFENITELY needs improvement<br />
then you are invited to suggest how it can be improved. So do not expect the world of it for we are just scratching the surface! This software is presented as open source under GPL2+ license, so everyone can develop it in the way he/she likes, but it would be nice to inform the rest of the world of your findings.<br />
This project will soon be housed on GitHub. In the meantime constructive input can be sent to dja@calamityjaneexpress.net. <br />
As of this moment I have some prio's to take care of, so I might not seem too responsive, but I will be as soon as possible. So please have some patience...

</div>

<h3>What is the project's goal?</h3>
<div>
<p>This project is to provide a newly to be developed web-framework plus appropriate "bulleted-user-interface" or "bui", especially built for emergencies but also well fit for non-emergency situations, as explained in the rest of the document.</p>
</div>

<h3>What is to be developed?</h3>
<div>
<p>This project exists out of 2+1 parts:<br />
1. Calamity Jane Express(R) (:CJE), an emergency web-framework and itself a core part of "WODAF".<br />
2. WODAF: Web Of Data And Functions, the complete web-framework. Both make use of a so-called bulleted-user-interface or "bui", where all items have a uniform "bullet"-shape and can  easily be relocated, grouped, mixed, related to one another or manipulated.<br />
3. WOS/3 (on a longer term): Web of Operating Systems based on Open Standards with On-going Symantics. Here the (tech-neutral) Operating Systems intelligently work together and can freely move around, since they are virtualized. 
</p>
</div>

<h3>What does this web-framework and bulleted-user-interface consist of?</h3>
<div>
<p>Let's say that each item (whatever) has a content and a context (:meta-data). The content-data can either or not be web-based, either or not be XML-well-formed and either or not use open standards. The context-data must be of web-based design, based on open standards and XML-well-formed to function properly when processed by system intelligence, to which this project is ultimately striving at. This strictness of context-data should not be a problem since it is developed from scratch: no "heel-dragging-legacy" here!<br />
And no longer complete data- and app-files, but data-pieces and separately addressable web-functions are at the focus. They can freely be mixed and related with each other, hence the name WODAF: Web Of Data And functions and actually an extension of Tim Berners Lee predicted "Web of Data", may also be mentioned "WODAF, Lord of the Web". The data and functions can be applied to a common addressable (text-, image-, video-, widget etc.) canvas for data-presentation or -manipulation, if configured so by the end-user. That's right: functionality completely and easily defined by the end-user as a web-enabled app or "wepp" and on the fly (remember the project's goal?). At last a truly personalized device!<br />
The CJE-framework must be flexible and rock-solid at the same time, because it has to "stand tall" in an emergency situation. The rest (i.e. non-emergency part) of the larger (WODAF-)framework may be more relaxed. Both are yet to be designed.<br />
For this highly granular and dynamic web-framework, also a new user-interface is to be developed. The existing interfaces as the desktop-user-interface (:dui) and even the icon-user-interface (:iui) are too static, hardly down-scalable (:dui), not based on separate addressable functions and can't (easily) use a common addressable canvas. The new user-interface called bulleted-user-interface or "bui" with its freely end-user-relocatable and -manipulatable "bullets" (that can be locked in place if necessary) ,is better fit for the job. The term "bullet" stands for bulletin, i.e. information, but is also in style with the "Calamity Jane Express(R)" vocabulary: (message-)Bullets that are Shoot to SERVE and SAVE People, Pets and Properties! In this web-framework "bullets" can refer to (passive) data and/or (executable) functions.<br />
A sophisticated protection mechanism is also to be developed so that things will be right in place from the start. We should have learned from the successes and pitfalls from the past 30 years, so let's do it right this time!</p>
</div>

<h3>At what devices is it aimed?</h3>
<div>
<p>Not the legacy PC but the high-end smartphone, here upgraded to "PC2", is considered the future center of a personal network; PC2: Portable and Personal Computer and Communicator. The desktop, laptop and yes, even tablets, are considered to become peripherals to the (high-end) smartphone one day. For nowadays, high-end smartphones are capable enough to accomplish common daily computer-tasks, while also providing 24/7-communication and 24/7-mobility by nature: it has got it all for personal needs! And for tasks that demand real horsepower and/or central coordination, we will (re-)introduce the domestic server.<br />
Another important thing of the just upgraded "PC2" is that it's default workings is not only browser-based, but that the browser's "butt" is tightly covered by an on-board Personal Proxy-Server  (:P2S). The browser's main occupation is thus confined to pleasing the end-user by "looking good" and "behaving well" and doing plain HTTP/IP communication with its on-board server. Real data-crunching, -storage and -network-communication is done by the "P2S" and there exists excellent server-side frameworks that have proven themselves well on this for many years. This means that the device's network-communication is upgraded to server-to-server (:p2p) level and that offers many advantages: it now potentially has a plethora of well proven and sophisticated communication protocols to it's disposal, able to communicate with just about anything!<br />
So, in this to be developed web-framework the high-end smartphone, or PC2, is actually double upgraded!</p>
</div>

<h3>How about its networking?</h3>
<div>
<p>All the networking is done by the on-board personal proxy server, so so HTTP/IP is the only internal used communication protocol used by the browser. The browser takes only care of front-end processing.<br />
In the default situation all communication is done on p2p level. The standards to be used should be the ones best fit for emergency situations. Special p2p social software and p2p search engines are already being developed on the Internet and might be interesting candidates. All these kind of things are very important, because after some disaster and in a shattered area, people should be able to setup some kind of a local communication network. With this network they can design a map of threats, needs and resources;. Standards for all this already exist (cap, edxl etc). In this emergency network the people's devices are to be multi-purpose: they can also serve as routers, backup storage, or do some kind of federated processing of emergency information. If at least one of the devices manages to be connected to the Internet, it can act as a gateway for the rest of the on-the-fly emergency network. To prevent indigestion and to increase network performance, data must be sent in standardized emergency codes, that, when arrived at the users devices, is translated into the users mother-tongue with the help of a standardized hash translation table. Processor power, storage capacity and communication throughput can be shared in the network to increase its resilience, especially during an emergency situation. This federated setup is also advocated by the W3C web standardization organization, and they have on-line literature on that.<br />
If you are on-the-go and not directly connected with a network (PAN, LAN or WAN) the data/functions can be buffered; this might also be done if you are connected, but just out of performance reasons (e.g. slow network).<br />
In an emergency situation, a network might get jammed because of the huge amount of traffic. Actually it is better not to send complete message (and to make things worse, one in each language), but to use codes, that will be translated at the device in the mother-tongue of the owner. This would be both a very efficient way of data-compression and an effective  way of data-encryption.<br />
There are already communities in our world world that have such an ad-hoc mesh it-network, and have certain knowledge and skill about how to let these things work in a stretched-out area with scarce it-means.</p>
</div>

<h3>An on-board personal proxy server?</h3>
<div>
<p>
An on-board personal proxy takes care of all communications with the network and with the device file-system itself.<br />
The front-end only communicates with the user, and of course it's proxy, and with the latter it's based on (x)(ht)ml, http and ip, local storage and cache are not active (not necessary).
Towards the front-end(/user) it acts as a HTTP server, towards the networks it can act as any server (since it can make use of any server protocol). In its first pre-release the server does not act as a proxy, nor has it any proxy facilities. Web-processing ((x)html, css and  JavaScript) can fully be done by the front-end or divided by the front-end and its back-end (pre/post processing). Even JavaScript can (partially) be moved to the back-end (ssjs). There exist excellent server-side/back-end frameworks nowadays like Java, PHP and .Net. These are not just simple but really sophisticated frameworks that are able to do just about anything you want... and they can be sitting on your device. Because of this concept all devices communicate with the Internet and each other on p2p level. Back-end to Front-end communication is considered a responsibility of the devices themselves.<br />
When a device contacts the cloud it now becomes part of the cloud itself, thanks to its server-oriented nature towards the rest of the network. E.g. cross-domain is no longer a problem, because this becomes the responsibility of the server which has excellent capability by nature to perform conditions-based communication. It is now also possible for the device to simply communicate with anything on any protocol and any (content)format, since the server can take care of this intermediate protocol- and format-translation at behalf of the front-end.
The moment the end device is being connected with its ISP (Internet Service Provider), it not just connects with the cloud, but becomes a part of the cloud itself, thanks to it's existing on-board server. That means that, while being on-line, direct contact with a device next to you is not regarded as a connection outside the Internet but as a connection within that same Internet.</p>
</div>

<h3>What is the goal of this to-be CJE web-framework in a (potential) emergency situation?</h3>
<div>
<p>The basic ideas are:<br /><br />

1. On the device (:cell) itself:<br />
-setup a special emergency map (or even separate sdcard) that is all about emergencies, whether data or software, and especially aimed at the owners conditions and preferences.<br />
-have as much as possible for the owner important "stuff" on-board as not to be dependent on the default networks: in emergency situations default networks often black out because of getting jammed, damaged or even broke.<br />
-having on-board intelligence to provide the owner hit-'n-run information to help him/herself or others to get out of some threatening situation.(1)<br /><br />  

2. In a local network (:cluster):<br />
-setup a local mesh ad-hoc communication network so that people in the "emergency area" can share information concerning threats, needs and resources.<br />
-having on-board intelligence that can do "auto"-communication on its own, so that the users attention can be freed up for other things: "IT can do things without asking questions".(1)<br /><br />

3. On the Internet (:cloud):<br />
-when it manages to contact the Internet, it can function as a gateway to the rest of the local network.<br />
-having on-board intelligence that can do "auto"-communication with emergency-specialized sites.(1)<br /><br />

(1) This is where the future to be integrated W3 standard organization's intelligent rdf/owl framework kicks in.</p>
</div>

<h3>Are there already standards for these kind of situations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Definitely. This is a list of web-sites where the various relevant open standards can be taken from:<br /><br />

Mobile and social open standards:<br />
http://www.w3.org/TR/mw4d-roadmap/: Mobile Web for Social Development Roadmap.<br />
http://www.w3.org/UbiWeb/: Ubiquitous Web Domain.<br />
http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/: Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0.<br />
http://www.w3.org/Mobile/: HTML5, CSS3, numerous JavaScript APIs etc.<br /><br />

Emergency open standards:<br />
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/eiif/XGR-Framework-20090806/: W3C EIIF Incubator Group Report<br />
http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/Draft_chater_of_EITF: Emergency Information Task Force (EITF).<br />
https://www.oasis-open.org/: relevant emergency management standards.<br /><br />

One might say that some sites seems to be dormant. Maybe...How about some wake-up call! :-)</p>

</div>

 <h3>Old or brandnew ideas?</h3>
<div>
<p>
To show that the ingredients of this project is everything but brandnew, let's look over the ideas, technologies and initiatives that are already exist or are going on respectively, some even dated back into the nineties of the previous century!<br />
-A personal on-board server? Microsoft introduced this in the ninetees of the prvious century with Windoes 95/98, but it didn't realy get off at that time, so let's give it a second change.<br />
-A domestic server? Again Microsoft introduced this in the beginning of this century, because it was "about time for consumers to have one" according to Steve Balmer. The introduction wasn't booming either, in other words: it should deserve a second chance.<br />
-A smartphone being the heart of a tablet? The ASUS Padfone was introduced in summer 2011 and it has follow-ups until these days. It's a smartphone, that fits into a tablet. Don't know about it's succes, but the idea itself is not bad at all. One can make the connection between tablet and smartphone wireless, e.g. with Transferjet or even  Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) which is compatible with wifi. Thgis way the connection becomes more universal (read: easy).<br /> 
-A tablet with smartphone in a tablet in a docking keyboard? Keyboard docks for tablets already exists, so this is nothing new. So a smartphone in a tablet in a docking keyboard should not alien anymore.<br />
-A smartphone projecting it's HD wirelses to a HDTV? There are already numerous TV-sets that make this happen via the standard DLNA an uPNP.<br />
-Chaining/piping functionality of various websites into some endresult? This is just what Yahoo's Piping initiative is doing. If this somehow could be combined with some universal on-board chaining/piping structure, i.e. independent of application, operating system etc., one could set up a true worldwide operating network(ed) processor!<br />
-Only the universal just-in-time and freely relocatable "bullet", introduced by the Calamity Jane Express(R) project, that can represent any data-piece or (app/web-)function from anyone, anywhere at anytime, is nothing but ... a JQuery UI sortable list-item! And one can not only drag/drop items within a list, but also between lists or just drop items on top of each other and let some action happen (:http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists). And in HTML li(st) elements may contain "flow" elements, i.e. block and inline elements, i.e. practically anything. So, lists and their items can represent anything (passive data and/or active app/web-functions) and be (re)located anywhere (local on a device or remote on a network), from anyone or anything (i.e. independent from some underlying technology). Voila, the most basic principle of the whole "Calamity Jane Express(R)" project in one phrase!<br /> 
-All other things like open standards, semantics, ubiquitus computing and communication and a preferred federative network structure etc are already advocated for many years by W3C and other standard organisations.This also applies to the field of emergencies. See a "List Of Links" for their websites.<br />
<br />
Ergo: Nothing new under the sun, just some re-arranging and re-combining, but where probably something called "topsight" (:David Gelertner's book "Mirror Worlds") might kick in...<br />
</p>
</div>

 <h3>Practical use of this concept</h3>
<div>
<p>Like said, this specific version (0.1alpha) web-enabled (:wepp) is not meant as the "silver bullet" that is gonna do it all, just an initial simplified materialization of some bigger concept. Though we already might give some examples how it might be used in future "wepps":<br />
1. no longer crawling into sub....sub-windows/tabs to change settings, since you can copy/move most-used settings-bullets to topclips. For as you know, bullets are always part of 1 or more clips (:collection of bullets) and clips are involved in hierarchical relationships, with topclips at the ehh... top.<br />
2. extreme high personalization, because you can mix data- and function-bullets in any combination.<br />
3. simple dups: A clip composed by you with some purpose may contain bullets that can easily be duplicated into other clips by drag and drop as often as you like.<br />
...more...
</p>
</div>
 
<h3>How to test plus some tips.</h3>
<div>
<p>This software has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S2  GT-I9100 international version. Android version: 2.3.6 Gingerbread. It must be said that the best mobile browsing results came from an "outsider": Dolphin Browser mobile version 9.3.2 (www.dolphin.com). The "established" mobile browsers sometimes showed unpredicted behaviour. Well, let's blame it on this still inmature CJE-software. Users should try out for themselves which browsers might give the best results.</p>
<p>When using the online Webversion you will be able to do all kind of manipulations, including temporarely saving it into your internal memory but excluding creating bullets (items) and saving things onto your disk.</p>
<p>If you want this then you need the DEVELOPERS version (Linux only, but to be ported to Windows, Mac etc) and should have a (software) server installed</p>
<p>TIP1: Do NOT use the browsers Backpage-key or you might mess up CJE's internal history-track. Use CJE's own Backward- and Forward-button on the footer of the page instead (should be taken care off in next versions). You might use function-key F11 "Full Screen" to avoid accidently pressing the browsers Backpage-button.</p>
<p>TIP2: Actually this software-version is developed for a smartphone screensize, although the idea itself of a "bulleted-user-interface" or "bui" is also excellent for desktop screensize and larger. If you use desktop screensize, you might simulate the smartphone-view by just shrinking the browser to smartphone size.</p>
<p>TIP3: Remember that many suggestions mentioned here are "functionality-to-be", i.e. they might not be implemented as of yet. So do NOT expect the world of it, because we're just scratching the surface!</p>

<h3>Technical Basics.</h3>
<p>***Web-based design, based on open-standards and XML-well-formed (at least for the context-data part)***</p>
<div id="accordion2">
<h3>The software part.</h3>
<div>
<p>Things that are mentioned are proposals for development, but might not be developed as of yet.<br /><br />

The most basic parts of the CJE-Framework (:CJEF) are:<br />
-a freely relocatable (:drag/drop) list-item, or "bullet" in CJE-vocabulary. However these "bullets" can be locked in place, if the order is of importance.<br />
-a list-view, or "clip" in CJE-vocabulary, containing the list-items.<br />
-a dialog screen, new page or rectangular (within a page) where the common result(s) of one or multiple actions are presented, known as "common canvas" or B-Field in CJE-vocabulary.</p>
</div>

<h3>Description of the 3 CJEF basic parts. Can be manipulated on the fly in any way.</h3>
<div>
<p>Bullets main characteristics:<br />
-can be freely dragged and dropped within a clip and between clips.<br />
-can be multiplied to as many clips as you like, but only 1 per clip.<br />
-can exist along any other bullet within a clip (:any-mix).<br />
-can:<br />
	-contain or refer to a specific data-piece or a specific (web-)function.<br />
	-refer to the whole data-file or the whole web-file.<br />
-can Not contain other bullets.<br />
-can somehow be related with other bullets, but only through their clips they are into (as of yet): indirect relationship.<br />
-content-data is a one-liner (:1L) containing so-called ASCII characters, and has an ID; or is empty (i.e. no content), but has an ID<br />
-can have attributes that serve as meta/context-data.<br />
-future: can have direct relationships with other bullets.</p>
</div>

<h3>Clips main characteristics:</h3>
<div>
<p>-can contain bullets (:relationship is that bullet is a member of 1 or more clips).<br /> 
-can contain other clips, aka pseudo-bullets, since they have the same form as "normal" bullets on the display.<br />
-can have a hierarchical relationship with each other.<br />
-have no content-data.<br />
-have, at least device-wide, a unique ID.<br />
-future: can have other than hierarchical relationships with each other.</p>
</div>

<h3>Common Canvas (:B-Field) main characteristics:</h3>
<div>
<p>-place where the final content of bullets are made visible/audible (:"exploded"), especially: text/widgets, images, video and audio.<br />
-can contain multiple canvas of other kinds, e.g. text and images in video or vice versa.<br />
-can occur on multiple places, e.g. text-keeping rectangular on a TV-screen.<br />
-addressable by any (passive) data-bullet, to "explode" their content into, once allowed to.<br />
-addressable by any (active) function-bullet that can act upon it, once allowed to.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bullets' and clips' notations:</h3>
<div>
<p>Every bullet is nothing but a XML-well formed list-item, that is characteristically (e.g CSS-) styled, once it hits the display.<br />
This bullet is at least present in two files, from which one is called the bullet-file. This bullet-file is an XML file, in which every bullet occurs exactly 1 time, and that harbors the complete content/reference (:content-data) with an (at least) device-wide (and thus also bullet-file-wide) unique ID. The other XML-file(s) is(/are) called clip-file(s) and contain (content-) empty bullets with nothing but a corresponding ID and some context(/meta)-data in it's attributes. In this(/these) XML-file(s) the bullets always exist as members of a clip, in XML terms: a bullet-element is a child of a clip-element, which itself is then a child of the root. Bullets can be a member of multiple clips (1 per clip) and thus don't have to be unique within a clip file. A clip is also nothing but a list-item with no content and can also be a child (:sub-clip) of other clips, as long as there exists also exactly 1 clip as child of the XML-root (:root-clip). Every "root-clip" must have an (at least) device-wide (and thus also clip-file-wide) unique ID. A bullet on the other hand is "atomic" in that it cannot contain other bullets. Although is is possible to split a bullet into multiple bullets or join multiple bullets into a single bullet by some explicit action. A bullet is actually nothing but a single line closed by a newline-character and it can be noted as:<br />

pseudo-1liner (:P1L): a text-line containing tags and finally closed by a newline-character; once read into an HTML file, the lines are broken in to multiple lines at the point where the <br /> tag occurs.<br />
The attributes in these files contain context- or meta-data and are in the (nearby?) future derived (e.g. for performances reasons) from a W3C* RDF/OWL compliant semantic repository as structural part of the CJE-Framework. This way it can also participate into a much wider federated intelligent W3C RDF/OWL based framework(s).</p>

<h3>Something about the origins of the "Calamity Jane Express(R)" project.</h3>
<div id="accordion3">
<h3>What is the origin of the "Calamity Jane Express(R)" project?</h3>
<div>
<p>The predicted year 2000 catastrophe, which happened to be a non-event, was at the start of the CJE project.<br />
Nevertheless, instead of quiting things alltogether, I continued Internet search and homebrew research/development concerning calamities and technologies to counter such situations, more or less until today. So it was a 13-years period of surfing from (open) standards to standards, from technologies to technologies, from ideas and initiatives to ideas and initiatives to find the combination that might be right fit for the job. It indeed took some time...<br />
Certain conclusions of disaster reports also found their way into this project. One of their main conclusions was that people not just wait for help and/or run around like Chicken Little. As soon as people find out that a disaster of some kind happened or is likely to happen, they take or at least try to take the appropriate actions themselves. So, instead of often being considered as a part of the problem by many governments, they actually should be considered as a (potential) part of the solution by the same governments! Because with the right information and skills they are able to do much more than most governments think. Other reports mention the need for a communications system for the common people to help themselves and each other. 
</p>
</div>

<h3>Is this where "Calamity Jane Express(R)" kicks in?</h3>
<div>
<p>Actually... yes! It should make it possible to quickly find the emergency information people are looking for, and to communicate with each other and the rest of the world.<br />
The intention of the CJE-Framework is:<br /> 
1. An intelligent device based system that has enough "software-power" so that it can take care of itself and also provide its owner as much as possible of emergency related information (text, images, video, audio) so they can help themselves and theirs (people, pets and properties) when completely cut off from any networks.<br />
2. To be able to quickly setup a local web-based p2p ad-hoc mesh network in case of an emergency when communication utilities black out. From here people can set up a community to record the threats, needs and resources and make use of that information to help themselves and each other. This network should also be able to (automatically) seek for contact with the outside world and exchange information with it, especially with governments. <br />
CJE has as its base with the common people with their smartphone. The smartphone herein is no longer regarded as just a "toything" but upgraded to the next generation pc: pc/2, pc version 2 or just pc2, to distinguish it from the legacy PC. The CJE-Framework stands for maximum opportunism and promiscuity: it can "eat" anything and can work together side by side with legacy technology (you only need a browser and an on-board server on some operating system).<br />
There are already several open standards, technologies, ideas and initiatives to accomplish this. This project welcomes all of this and tries to find out how things might work together. </p>

<h3>Why the name "Calamity Jane Express(R)"?</h3>
<div>
<p>Calamity Jane was a famous an adventurous woman who lived in the Wild West of the 19th century and who knew well how to handle a rifle. In a certain period of her live she was also a post-woman for the US army. It is from this episode that the name "Calamity Jane Express(R)" was derived.</p>
</div>

<h3>Just another basic idea behind the Calamity Jane Express(R) project.</h3>
<div>
<p>Calamity Jane Express(R) stands for maximal opportunism and promiscuity: make use of ANY opportunity and be able to work with ANYTHING to get out of some threatening situation. The digital framework must reflect this idea. One result of this is that it must be tech-neutral: any technology suffices, as long as it complies with the underlying (open) emergency standards.</p>
</div>

<h3>A personal note.</h3>
<div>
<p>Actually this whole text should have been placed in a public available blog on the Internet. But then I had to find out which site has maximum reach for the purpose that I've on my mind, and I don't wanted to spend much too time on that. No experience in publicly sharing one's thoughts? I'm sorry, I'm not that into the "Internet socio-thing" (:Facebook et al). I was, back in the nineties, into something called "Active Worlds" (similar to "Second Live" nowadays) for a few weeks. It was the first and the last time I ever got into this, because I found the conversation-level not really "my thing". It might work for others, but not for me I guess. I don't know if it has changed these days. Nevertheless, I did only recently register myself on Facebook, Youtube and Twitter, together with this project, in case it might be needed somehow.<br /> 
One important thing that I remembered from my time spent into "Active Worlds" is, what I now use to call the "First Internet Law": On the Internet everyone/everything can claim to be everyone/everything and state everything. "Everyone/everything"? Yes, because in the (nearby?) future the technology will be so advanced that it can precisely mimic a human voice. So you think you are talking to a human being, while you're actually talking to a bunch of semi-conductors that accept and respond only in electric pules (:one's and zero's), mimicking a human voice once it has reached your speakers. And you can't tell the difference! Then how about somebody claiming that he/she is Napoleon? Ok, that's an easy one to find out, because Napoleon is a "HE" and happens to be dead for 2 centuries. Everybody knows that (I presume). In other cases, sometimes with help of some photoshoTs here and some photoshoPPing there, you can mimic ANYONE in ANY way (:situation/position/event)! Generally speaking, credibility will be more and more become of an issue in the future. That's why we should try to incorporate a good credibility-check mechanism into this framework from the very start, at least in the CJE-Framework core part.<br />
Another one: back into time I found out I'm more into what is called top-sight-approach, -research and -development (:frameworks, structures etc) then being a software specialist trying to develop the "silver bullet" application. Probably every developer (for good or for bad) secretly dreams of an H-Bomb-App that blasts the whole IT-world into Ground Zero and shells-hocked, forcing everyone to restart all-over from scratch. Well, I can now say that I will not be one of them :-( And for the time being this "wepp" will not be changing things as they go very soon, since it will be 1 "wepp" versus 1.800.000(?) apps...ehhh...uhhh... Well maybe not "versus", because like said, it can peacefully coexist with and even make use of the legacy way of doing things, but it's just ready to take off in a direction of its own, once the time is there!<br />
One final point: it may look as if this work is somewhat abruptly stopped and then thrown into the public. That's right. This initial version is setup like quick and dirty and actually not really fit for publication as of yet. But I do it anyway so that people can already peek and poke into it if they like. The reason for this premature publication is a financial one, or to be more precise: the COMPLETE ABSENCE thereof. So the coming period I might not be too responsive because I've some "other prio's" on my mind (guess what:-). But I will return as soon as possible to pick up where I left off. So, have some patience please...

<h3>FAQ's, QTB, QTE's and REQ's.</h3>
<div>
FAQ: Frequently Asked Question, PUQ:  Public Question, QTE: Question To Experts, REQ: Recursive Question.<br />
1b. PUQ: Is there a FREE and SIMPLE  CGI server for smartphones, so that ordinary users can operate CJE from their own device without all kinds of latencies? I couldn't find one, at least not for Android. <br />
1a. QTE: Or maybe a SIMPLE cgi server script made with BusyBox (non-root version). I got the script, but how to connect it to inetd...?
