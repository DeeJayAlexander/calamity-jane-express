<h3>Calamity Jane Express (R) </h3>
(a registered trademark in the U.S. and other countries)<br />
<br />

<h3>The project's goal and manifest.</h3>
<div id="accordion1">

<h3>What is the project's goal?</h3>
<div>
<p>This project is to provide a newly to be developed web-framework plus appropriate "bullet-user-interface" or "CJE-bui", especially built for emergencies and mobile devices, but also well fit for non-emergency situations and non-mobile devices thanks to it's high scalability, as explained in the rest of the document.</p>
</div>

<h3>What is to be developed?</h3>
<div>
<p>This project exists out of 2+1 parts:<br />
1. Calamity Jane Express(R) (:CJE), an emergency web-framework and itself a core part of "WODAF".<br />
2. WODAF: Web Of Data And Functions, the complete web-framework. Both make use of a so-called bullet-user-interface or "CJE-bui", where all items have a uniform "bullet"-shape and can  easily be relocated, grouped, mixed, related to one another or manipulated.<br />
3. WOS/3 (on a longer term): Web of Operating Systems based on Open Standards with On-going Symantics. Here the (tech-neutral) Operating Systems intelligently work together and can freely move around, since they are virtualized. 
</p>
</div>

<h3>What does this web-framework and bullet-user-interface consist of?</h3>
<div>
<p>Let's say that each item (whatever) has a content and a context (:meta-data). The content-data can either or not be web-based, either or not be XML-well-formed and either or not use open standards. The context-data must be of web-based design, based on open standards and XML-well-formed to function properly when processed by system intelligence, to which this project is ultimately striving at. This strictness of context-data should not be a problem since it is developed from scratch: no "heel-dragging-legacy" here!<br />
And no longer complete data- and app-files, but data-pieces and separately addressable web-functions are at the focus. They can freely be mixed and related with each other, hence the name WODAF: Web Of Data And functions and actually an extension of Tim Berners Lee predicted "Web of Data", may also be mentioned "WODAF, Lord of the Web". The data and functions can be applied to a common addressable (text-, image-, video-, widget etc.) canvas for data-presentation or -manipulation, if configured so by the end-user. That's right: functionality completely and easily defined by the end-user as a web-enabled app or "wepp" and on the fly (remember the project's goal?). At last a truly personalized device!<br />
The CJE-framework must be flexible and rock-solid at the same time, because it has to "stand tall" in an emergency situation. The rest (i.e. non-emergency part) of the larger (WODAF-)framework may be more relaxed. Both are yet to be designed.<br />
For this highly granular and dynamic web-framework, also a new user-interface is to be developed. The existing interfaces as the desktop-user-interface (:dui) and even the icon-user-interface (:iui) are too static, hardly down-scalable (:dui), not based on separate addressable functions and can't (easily) use a common addressable canvas. The new user-interface called bullet-user-interface or "CJE-bui" with its freely end-user-relocatable and -manipulatable "bullets" (that can be locked in place if necessary) ,is better fit for the job. The term "bullet" stands for bulletin, i.e. information, but is also in style with the "Calamity Jane Express(R)" vocabulary: (message-)Bullets that are Shoot to SERVE and SAVE People, Pets and Properties! In this web-framework "bullets" can refer to (passive) data and/or (executable) functions.<br />
A sophisticated protection mechanism is also to be developed so that things will be right in place from the start. We should have learned from the successes and pitfalls from the past 30 years, so let's do it right this time!</p>
</div>

<h3>Why xml well-formed?</h3>
<div>
<p>Any xml-based data can be mixed with each other and easily be separated from each other. Not only data but also applications, operating systems and even hardware (xml appliances) can be (partly) partitioned this way. The processflow between frontend (presentation markup) and backend (processing/transport/storage format) is now seamless, no hiccups between front and backend anymore. This partitioning adds to modular design that has benefits: distinguishable parts can be separately addressed that make things easier to handle and things can be outsourced to those that are experts on certain fields.<br />
In the world of web based apps html notation is leading, and the closest notation to html is xml, nor json, turtle or anything else. To put things more clearly, if html can be well formed to xhtml, than it becomes just a subclass of xml. This opens the way to a plethora of xml based tools for the frontend, but also standardized intelligent frameworks that are often based on strictly defined components (like rdf/owl). To avoid any misunderstanding, json and turtle et all have proved their value in many conditions, so they're here to stay. The right tool for the right job: no question about it. Period.<br />
</p>

</div>

<h3>Technical Basics (the building blocks).</h3>
<p>***Web-based design, based on open-standards and XML-well-formed (at least for the context-data part)***</p>
<div id="accordion2">
<h3>The 3 CJE basic parts.</h3>
<div>
<p>
The most basic parts of the CJE-Framework (:CJEF) are:<br />
-a freely relocatable (:drag/drop) list-item, or "bullet" in CJE-vocabulary. However these "bullets" can be locked in place, if the order is of importance.<br />
-a list-view, or "clip" in CJE-vocabulary, containing the list-items.<br />
-a dialog screen, new page or rectangular (within a page) where the common result(s) of one or multiple actions are presented, known as "common canvas" or E-Field in CJE-vocabulary.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bullets main characteristics.</h3>
<div>
<p>
-can be freely dragged and dropped within a clip and between clips.<br />
-can be multiplied to as many clips as you like, but only 1 per clip.<br />
-can exist along any other bullet within a clip (:any-mix).<br />
-can:<br />
	-contain or refer to a specific data-piece or a specific (web-)function.<br />
	-refer to the whole data-file or the whole web-file.<br />
-can Not contain other bullets.<br />
-can somehow be related with other bullets, but only through their clips they are into (as of yet): indirect relationship.<br />
-content-data is a one-liner (:1L) containing so-called ASCII characters, and has an ID; or is empty (i.e. no content), but has an ID<br />
-can have attributes that serve as meta/context-data.<br />
-future: can have direct relationships with other bullets.</p>
</div>

<h3>Clips main characteristics.</h3>
<div>
<p>-can contain bullets (:relationship is that bullet is a member of 1 or more clips).<br /> 
-can contain other clips, aka pseudo-bullets, since they have the same form as "normal" bullets on the display.<br />
-can have a hierarchical relationship with each other.<br />
-have no content-data.<br />
-have, at least device-wide, a unique ID.<br />
-future: can have other than hierarchical relationships with each other.</p>
</div>

<h3>Common Canvas (:E-Field) main characteristics.</h3>
<div>
<p>-place where the final content of bullets are made visible/audible (:"exploded"), especially: text/widgets, images, video and audio.<br />
-can contain multiple canvas of other kinds, e.g. text and images in video or vice versa.<br />
-can occur on multiple places, e.g. text-keeping rectangular on a TV-screen.<br />
-addressable by any (passive) data-bullet, to "explode" their content into, once allowed to.<br />
-addressable by any (active) function-bullet that can act upon it, once allowed to.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bullets' and clips' notations.</h3>
<div>
<p>Every bullet is nothing but a XML-well formed list-item, that is characteristically (e.g CSS-) styled, once it hits the display.<br />
This bullet is at least present in two files, from which one is called the bullet-file. This bullet-file is an XML file, in which every bullet occurs exactly 1 time, and that harbors the complete content/reference (:content-data) with an (at least) device-wide (and thus also bullet-file-wide) unique ID. The other XML-file(s) is(/are) called clip-file(s) and contain (content-) empty bullets with nothing but a corresponding ID and some context(/meta)-data in it's attributes. In this(/these) XML-file(s) the bullets always exist as members of a clip, in XML terms: a bullet-element is a child of a clip-element, which itself is then a child of the root. Bullets can be a member of multiple clips (1 per clip) and thus don't have to be unique within a clip file. A clip is also nothing but a list-item with no content and can also be a child (:sub-clip) of other clips, as long as there exists also exactly 1 clip as child of the XML-root (:root-clip). Every "root-clip" must have an (at least) device-wide (and thus also clip-file-wide) unique ID. A bullet on the other hand is "atomic" in that it cannot contain other bullets. Although is is possible to split a bullet into multiple bullets or join multiple bullets into a single bullet by some explicit action. A bullet is actually nothing but a single line closed by a newline-character and it can be noted as:<br />
one/1liner (:1L): a text-line with no HTML tags and finally closed by a newline-character.<br />
pseudo-1liner (:P1L): a text-line containing tags and finally closed by a newline-character; once read into an HTML file, the lines are broken in to multiple lines at the point where the <br /> tag occurs.<br />
The attributes in these files contain context- or meta-data and are in the (nearby?) future derived (e.g. for performances reasons) from a W3C* RDF/OWL compliant semantic repository as structural part of the CJE-Framework. This way it can also participate into a much wider federated intelligent W3C RDF/OWL based framework(s).</p>

<h3>The concept's materialization.</h3>
<div id="accordion3">
<h3>At what devices is it aimed?</h3>
<div>
<p>Not the legacy PC but the high-end smartphone, here upgraded to "PC2", is considered the future center of a personal network; PC2: Portable and Personal Computer and Communicator. The desktop, laptop and yes, even tablets, are considered to become peripherals to the (high-end) smartphone one day. For nowadays, high-end smartphones are capable enough to accomplish common daily computer-tasks, while also providing 24/7-communication and 24/7-mobility by nature: it has got it all for personal needs! And for tasks that demand real horsepower and/or central coordination, we will (re-)introduce the domestic server.<br />
Another important thing of the just upgraded "PC2" is that it's default workings is not only browser-based, but that the browser's "butt" is tightly covered by an on-board Personal Proxy-Server  (:P2S). The browser's main occupation is thus confined to pleasing the end-user by "looking good" and "behaving well" and doing plain HTTP/IP communication with its on-board server. Real data-crunching, -storage and -network-communication is done by the "P2S" and there exists excellent server-side frameworks that have proven themselves well on this for many years. This means that the device's network-communication is upgraded to server-to-server (:p2p) level and that offers many advantages: it now potentially has a plethora of well proven and sophisticated communication protocols to it's disposal, able to communicate with just about anything!<br />
So, in this to be developed web-framework the high-end smartphone, or PC2, is actually double upgraded!</p>
</div>

<h3>Its networking.</h3>
<div>
<p>All the networking is done by the on-board personal proxy server, so so HTTP/IP is the only internal used communication protocol used by the browser. The browser takes only care of front-end processing.<br />
In the default situation all communication is done on p2p level. The standards to be used should be the ones best fit for emergency situations. Special p2p social software and p2p search engines are already being developed on the Internet and might be interesting candidates. All these kind of things are very important, because after some disaster and in a shattered area, people should be able to setup some kind of a local communication network. With this network they can design a map of threats, needs and resources;. Standards for all this already exist (cap, edxl etc). In this emergency network the people's devices are to be multi-purpose: they can also serve as routers, backup storage, or do some kind of federated processing of emergency information. If at least one of the devices manages to be connected to the Internet, it can act as a gateway for the rest of the on-the-fly emergency network. To prevent indigestion and to increase network performance, data must be sent in standardized emergency codes, that, when arrived at the users devices, is translated into the users mother-tongue with the help of a standardized hash translation table. Processor power, storage capacity and communication throughput can be shared in the network to increase its resilience, especially during an emergency situation. This federated setup is also advocated by the W3C web standardization organization, and they have on-line literature on that.<br />
If you are on-the-go and not directly connected with a network (PAN, LAN or WAN) the data/functions can be buffered; this might also be done if you are connected, but just out of performance reasons (e.g. slow network).<br />
In an emergency situation, a network might get jammed because of the huge amount of traffic. Actually it is better not to send complete message (and to make things worse, one in each language), but to use codes, that will be translated at the device in the mother-tongue of the owner. This would be both a very efficient way of data-compression and an effective  way of data-encryption.<br />
There are already communities in our world world that have such an ad-hoc mesh it-network, and have certain knowledge and skill about how to let these things work in a stretched-out area with scarce it-means.</p>
</div>

<h3>An on-board personal proxy server.</h3>
<div>
<p>
An on-board personal proxy takes care of all communications with the network and with the device file-system itself.<br />
The front-end only communicates with the user, and of course it's proxy, and with the latter it's based on (x)(ht)ml, http and ip, local storage and cache are not active (not necessary).
Towards the front-end(/user) it acts as a HTTP server, towards the networks it can act as any server (since it can make use of any server protocol). In its first pre-release the server does not act as a proxy, nor has it any proxy facilities. Web-processing ((x)html, css and  JavaScript) can fully be done by the front-end or divided by the front-end and its back-end (pre/post processing). Even JavaScript can (partially) be moved to the back-end (ssjs). There exist excellent server-side/back-end frameworks nowadays like Java, PHP and .Net. These are not just simple but really sophisticated frameworks that are able to do just about anything you want... and they can be sitting on your device. Because of this concept all devices communicate with the Internet and each other on p2p level. Back-end to Front-end communication is considered a responsibility of the devices themselves.<br />
When a device contacts the cloud it now becomes part of the cloud itself, thanks to its server-oriented nature towards the rest of the network. E.g. cross-domain is no longer a problem, because this becomes the responsibility of the server which has excellent capability by nature to perform conditions-based communication. It is now also possible for the device to simply communicate with anything on any protocol and any (content)format, since the server can take care of this intermediate protocol- and format-translation at behalf of the front-end.
The moment the end device is being connected with its ISP (Internet Service Provider), it not just connects with the cloud, but becomes a part of the cloud itself, thanks to it's existing on-board server. That means that, while being on-line, direct contact with a device next to you is not regarded as a connection outside the Internet but as a connection within that same Internet.</p>
</div>

<h3>The domestic server.</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will also reintroduce a domestic hardware server, that forms the center of a domestic network and seamlessly works together with all other devices in the house. In the "Calamity Jane Express(R)" project we will ofcourse focus on its role as the center for emergency situations and the prevention thereof. Things like burgler-, smoke- and monoxide alarms could be attached to this network and be controlled from the pc2 (smartphone) via the central hardware server, which ofcourse can also serve other purposes (video and audio provision for example). The domestic server must be a turnkey installation thing, no expertise should be needed and might be build with older equipment that is not used, to start with. The idea of having a domestic hardware server and an onboard software server on your pc is not new; Microsoft introduced this idea  of a hardware server already at the beginning of this century and the idea of the software server even with Windows 95.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Mission of this to-be CJE web-framework in a (potential) emergency situation.</h3>
<div>
<p>The basic ideas are:<br /><br />

1. On the device (:cell) itself:<br />
-setup a special emergency map (or even separate sdcard) that is all about emergencies, whether data or software, and especially aimed at the owners conditions and preferences.<br />
-have as much as possible for the owner important "stuff" on-board as not to be dependent on the default networks: in emergency situations default networks often black out because of getting jammed, damaged or even broke.<br />
-having on-board intelligence to provide the owner hit-'n-run information to help him/herself or others to get out of some threatening situation.(1)<br /><br />  

2. In a local network (:cluster):<br />
-setup a local mesh ad-hoc communication network so that people in the "emergency area" can share information concerning threats, needs and resources.<br />
-having on-board intelligence that can do "auto"-communication on its own, so that the users attention can be freed up for other things: "IT can do things without asking questions".(1)<br /><br />

3. On the Internet (:cloud):<br />
-when it manages to contact the Internet, it can function as a gateway to the rest of the local network.<br />
-having on-board intelligence that can do "auto"-communication with emergency-specialized sites.(1)<br /><br />

(1) This is where the future to be integrated W3 standard organization's intelligent rdf/owl framework kicks in.</p>
</div>

<h3>Are there already standards for these kind of situations?</h3>
<div>
<p>Definitely. This is a list of web-sites where the various relevant open standards can be taken from:<br /><br />

Mobile and social open standards:<br />
http://www.w3.org/TR/mw4d-roadmap/: Mobile Web for Social Development Roadmap.<br />
http://www.w3.org/UbiWeb/: Ubiquitous Web Domain.<br />
http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/: Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0.<br />
http://www.w3.org/Mobile/: HTML5, CSS3, numerous JavaScript APIs etc.<br /><br />

Emergency open standards:<br />
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/eiif/XGR-Framework-20090806/: W3C EIIF Incubator Group Report<br />
http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/wiki/Draft_chater_of_EITF: Emergency Information Task Force (EITF).<br />
https://www.oasis-open.org/: relevant emergency management standards.<br /><br />

One might say that some sites seems to be dormant. Maybe...How about some wake-up call! :-)</p>
</div>

<h3>Old or brandnew ideas?</h3>
<div>
<p>
To show that the ingredients of this project is everything but brandnew, let's look over the ideas, technologies and initiatives that are already exist or are going on respectively, some even dated back into the nineties of the previous century!<br />
-A personal on-board server? Microsoft introduced this in the nineties of the previous century with Windows 95/98, but it didn't really get off at that time, so let's give it a second change.<br />
-A domestic server? Again Microsoft introduced this in the beginning of this century, because it was "about time for consumers to have one" according to Steve Balmer. The introduction wasn't booming either, in other words: it should deserve a second chance.<br />
-A smartphone being the heart of a tablet? The ASUS Padfone was introduced in summer 2011 and it has follow-ups until these days. It's a smartphone, that fits into a tablet. Don't know about it's success, but the idea itself is not bad at all. One can make the connection between tablet and smartphone wireless, e.g. with Transferjet or even  Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) which is compatible with wifi. This way the connection becomes more universal (read: easy).<br /> 
-A tablet with smartphone in a tablet in a docking keyboard? Keyboard docks for tablets already exists, so this is nothing new. So a smartphone in a tablet in a docking keyboard should not alien anymore.<br />
-A smartphone projecting it's HD wireless to a HDTV? There are already numerous TV-sets that make this happen via the standard DLNA an uPNP.<br />
-Chaining/piping functionality of various websites into some endresult? This is just what Yahoo's Piping initiative is doing. If this somehow could be combined with some universal on-board chaining/piping structure, i.e. independent of application, operating system etc., one could set up a true worldwide operating network(ed) processor!<br />
-Only the universal just-in-time and freely relocatable "bullet", introduced by the Calamity Jane Express(R) project, that can represent any data-piece or (app/web-)function from anyone, anywhere at anytime, is nothing but ... a JQuery UI sortable list-item! And one can not only drag/drop items within a list, but also between lists or just drop items on top of each other and let some action happen (:http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists). And in HTML li(st) elements may contain "flow" elements, i.e. block and inline elements, i.e. practically anything. So, lists and their items can represent anything (passive data and/or active app/web-functions) and be (re)located anywhere (local on a device or remote on a network), from anyone or anything (i.e. independent from some underlying technology). Voila, the most basic principle of the whole "Calamity Jane Express(R)" project in one phrase!<br /> 
-All other things like open standards, semantics, ubiquitous computing and communication and a preferred federative network structure etc are already advocated for many years by W3C and other standard organizations.This also applies to the field of emergencies. See a "List Of Links" for their websites.<br />
<br />
Ergo: Nothing new under the sun, just some re-arranging and re-combining, but where probably something called "topsight" (:David Gelertner's book "Mirror Worlds") might kick in...<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>A peek into the future.</h3>
<div id="accordion4">
<h3>WOS/3: a Web Of Operating Systems.</h3>
<div>
<p>In the future (intelligent) Operating Systems (OS) are no longer always started-up rooted into the hardware, but can freely move around and can somehow (smartly) be related to each other as, say WOS/3: Web Of Operating Systems, based On Open Standards and with Ongoing Semantics (what's in a name?). Their sizes can grow (by mounting) and shrink by (by unmounting) on the fly. This way virtual vehicles can be merged into a bigger system at a certain spot and split apart into its subparts in another spot. It can also just function as a piggyback carrier, carrying other OS's for portable devices, that can then be launched into the portable device at the right time. Even portable devices can have more than one vm into them, that themselves move in and out of the portable device (Samsung is developing one).<br />
In the nineties sun launched the slogan: the network is the computer. Now this can be complemented with slogan: the computer is the network. Why be satisfied with 1 operating system if you can have more operating systems on 1 machine?<br />
In the new situation all V2's are directly on top of the so-called (virtualization) hypervisor. So any V2 can be placed in front, but in some future CJE Framework for example, it will be the browserspecific V2 that is in the front, while others act as backend/broker/brain server V2's. V2's can keep an eye on each other to look for suspicious behavior that might reveal the presence of viruses or hacks. There is now not only a horizontal protection (within an operating system, e.g. administrator vs ordinary users) but also a vertical protection, namely between OS V2's. If one V2 is contaminated, you can just fire up an other one and have this infected V2 investigated by other V2's instead of a infected machine inspecting itself.<br />
</p>
</div>

<h3>The advantage of all-for-one vs one-for-all services.</h3>
<div>
<p>Back in time our early ancestors were hunter/gatherers. After a certain period, when the population increased, the rivalry amongst each other increased, because they were all more or less "fishing" in the same waters. Later, when living in communities, they found out that it might be better if each individual specializes in what he/she is good at and then exchange their products and/or services in a fair and common way. This fair  and common way of trade made sure that every one could make a reasonable living. It turned out to be that communities with the most specialized activities were florishing the most, compared to communities where its inhabbitants were doing more or less the same thing as to have a living.<br />
One can draw this comparisson also to web-based services. We can have a situation were everyone wants to be the one and only one-stop for everything or a situation where web-based services specializes where they are best in. They can then offer this on a fair and common "marketplace" were visitors can choose the services they need most and then compose their own "personalized solution" focussed on their specific situation, either with or without help of third parties. This can even go as far as just-in-time or hit-and-run functionality, i.e. on a per-use instead of a per-user basis in the most extreme situation. The CJE-Framework is just made for this, although it can work as well in more static situations. It's parts can be found on the CJE website itself, but also on other websites with specialized servcies. In the future we will try to integrate these different parts on different websites somehow into the CJE framework.</p>
