<bu cl="txt" xid="id_274">Stay away from floodwater. If you come upon a flooded road, turn around and go another way. Most hurricane-related deaths are caused by floods from heavy rainfall..</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_275">The National Hurricane Center reports that more then one-third of inland flooding deaths involve people trapped in cars while trying to escape rising water..</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_276">The depth of water is not always obvious. The roadbed may be washed out under the water, and you could be stranded or trapped. Rapidly rising water may stall the engine, engulf the vehicle and its occupants, and sweep them away..</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_277">As little as six inches of water may cause you to lose control of your vehicle and two feet (0.6 meter) of water will carry away most automobiles, SUVs, and pickup trucks..</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_451">Why talk about winter storms? Each year, exposure to cold, vehicle accidents caused by wintry roads, and fires caused by the improper use of heaters injure and kill hundreds of people in the United States. Add these to other winter weather hazards and you have a significant threat to human health and safety.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_452">A major winter storm can last for several days and can include high winds, freezing rain or sleet, heavy snowfall, and cold temperatures. People can become marooned at home without utilities or other services. Heavy snowfall and blizzards can trap motorists in their vehicles and make walking to find help a deadly effort. Storm effects, such as severely cold temperatures, heavy snow, and coastal flooding, can cause hazardous conditions and hidden problems. The aftermath of a winter storm can impact a community or region for days, weeks, or even months.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_453">What are winter storms? Winter storms can range from a moderate snow over a few hours to a blizzard with blinding, wind-driven snow that lasts for several days. Some winter storms are large enough to affect several states, while others affect only a single community. Many winter storms are accompanied by dangerously low temperatures and sometimes by strong winds, icing, sleet, and freezing rain.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_454">Winter storms are defined differently in various areas of the country, and each area is equipped differently to deal with the challenges and hazards of severe winter weather. A snowstorm that would be unremarkable in Buffalo, N.Y., could bring a city in the southern states to a standstill. Local emergency management offices, National Weather Service (NWS) offices, and American Red Cross chapters can provide definitions specific to each area.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_455">What damages can snow cause, and what are the different kinds of snow? Heavy snow can immobilize a region and paralyze a city, stranding commuters, closing airports, stopping the flow of supplies, and disrupting emergency and medical services. Accumulations of snow can cause roofs to collapse and knock down trees and power lines. Homes and farms may be isolated for days. In rural areas, unprotected livestock can be lost. In urban areas, the cost of snow removal, damage repair, and lost business can have severe economic impacts. In the mountains, heavy snow can lead to an avalancheâa mass of tumbling snow. More than 80 percent of midwinter avalanches are triggered by a rapid accumulation of snow, and 90 percent of those occur within 24 hours of snowfall. An avalanche can reach a mass of a million tons and travel at speeds up to 200 miles (322 kilometers) per hour.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_456">Various intensities of snow are defined differently:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_457">Blizzard describes winds of 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour or more with snow and blowing snow that reduce visibility to less than one-quarter mile (0.4 kilometer) for at least three hours.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_458">Blowing snow describes wind-driven snow that reduces visibility. Blowing snow may be falling snow and/or snow on the ground that is picked up by the wind.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_459">Snow squall describes a brief, intense snow shower accompanied by strong, gusty winds. Accumulation from snow squalls can be significant.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_460">Snow shower describes snow that falls at varying intensities for short durations with little or no accumulation.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_461">What damages can ice cause, and what are the different kinds of ice? Heavy accumulations of ice can bring down trees and topple utility poles and communication towers. Ice can disrupt communications and power for days while utility companies repair extensive damage. Even small accumulations of ice can be severely dangerous to motorists and pedestrians. Bridges and overpasses are particularly dangerous because they freeze before other surfaces.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_462">Ice forms in different ways:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_463">Sleet is rain that freezes into ice pellets before it reaches the ground. Sleet usually bounces when hitting a surface and does not stick to objects; however, it can accumulate like snow and cause roads and walkways to become hazardous.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_464">Freezing rain (also known as an ice storm) is rain that falls onto a surface that has a temperature below freezing. The cold surface causes the rain to freeze so the surfacesâtrees, utility wires, vehicles, and roadsâbecome glazed with ice. Even small accumulations of ice can cause significant hazards to peopleâespecially pedestrians and motoristsâand property.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_465">What damages can severe cold cause? What constitutes severe cold varies in different parts of the country. In some northern regions, cold temperatures are not considered severe until they are well below 0Â° F (â18Â° C). In most southern regions, near-freezing temperatures (around 32Â° F, or 0Â° C) are considered severe cold. Severe cold can cause much harm; for example, it can damage crops and other vegetation and freeze pipes causing them to burst. Unusually cold temperatures are especially dangerous in areas not accustomed to them because residents are generally unprepared and may not realize the dangers severe cold present.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_466">Exposure to cold can cause frostbite and life-threatening hypothermia. Frostbite is the freezing of body tissue, and it most frequently affects fingers, toes, earlobes, and the tip of the nose. Frostbite damage ranges from superficial and reversible to deep and permanent. Frostbite can result in tissue loss and even loss of digits and limbs.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_467">Hypothermia begins to occur when a personâs body temperature drops to 3Â° below its normal temperature. On average, a person would begin to suffer hypothermia if his or her temperature dropped to 96Â° F (35.6Â° C). Cold temperatures can cause hypothermia in anyone who is not adequately clothed or sheltered in a place with adequate heat. Hypothermia can kill people, and those who survive hypothermia are likely to suffer lasting ill effects. Infants and elderly people are the most susceptible. Elderly people account for the largest percentage of hypothermia victims, many of whom freeze to death in their own homes. Most of these victims are alone and their heating systems are working improperly or not at all. People who are taking certain medications, who have certain medical conditions, or who have been drinking alcohol also are at increased risk for hypothermia.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_468">What is winter flooding? Winter flooding can result from winter storms or long periods of cold temperatures, and it can cause significant damage and loss of life. The winds of intense winter storms can cause widespread tidal flooding and severe beach erosion along coastal areas. Long cold spells can cause rivers and lakes to freeze so that when a rise in the water level or a thaw breaks the ice into large chunks, the chunks become jammed at man-made and natural obstructions. These ice jams can act as dams, resulting in severe flooding. In addition, the sudden thawing of a heavy snow pack can often lead to flooding.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_469">How can I protect myself in winter storms? Winter storms are considered deceptive killers because most winter storm deaths are related only indirectly to the storms. Overall, most winter storm deaths result from vehicle or other transportation accidents caused by ice and snow. You should avoid driving when conditions include sleet, freezing rain or drizzle, snow, or dense fog. These are serious conditions that are often underestimated, and they make drivingâand even walking outsideâvery hazardous.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_470">Exhaustion and heart attacks brought on by overexertion are two other common causes of deaths related to winter storms. Cold temperatures compound the strain of physical labor on a personâs body. Tasks such as shoveling snow, pushing a vehicle, or even walking in heavy snow can cause a heart attack, particularly in people who are older or not used to high levels of physical activity. Before tackling strenuous tasks in cold temperatures, you should carefully consider your physical condition, the weather factors, and the nature of the task. If you are not sure how much you can safely do, you should avoid all heavy work in cold temperatures.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_471">You should also dress to protect yourself from frostbite and hypothermia. When outside in cold temperatures, wear warm, loose-fitting, lightweight clothing in several layers. If you get too warm, you can remove one or more layers and if you get too cold you can add layers, so you can avoid the sweat-chills cycle. Your outer garments should be tightly woven, water repellent, and have a hood. Wear a hat. Half of your body heat can be lost from your head. Mittens, snug at the wrist, are better than gloves. Try to stay dry. If it is extremely cold, cover your mouth to protect your lungs.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_472">If, during severe cold, your home loses power or heat, go to a designated public shelter. For information on designated shelters, contact your local emergency management office or American Red Cross chapter.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_473">Home fires occur more frequently in the winter because people do not take the proper safety precautions when using alternative heating sources. Be sure all heating sources are installed according to local codes and permit requirements. To protect yourself, be sure that you never leave a fire unattended, that you dispose of ashes properly and only after they are completely cold, and that you operate and position space heaters only according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Use only space heaters approved by an independent testing laboratory. Fire during winter storms is exceptionally dangerous because conditions may make it difficult for firefighters to get to the fire, and the water needed to fight the fire may be frozen.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_474">In addition, every winter people are killed by carbon monoxide (CO) emitted by fuels they are using to heat their homes. Never operate unvented fuel-burning appliances in any closed room or where people are sleeping. CO poisoning from fuel-burning appliances kills people each year in the United States. Never use gas appliances such as ranges, ovens, or clothes dryers to heat your home. Do not use charcoal grills indoors or in attached garages.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_475">Never use a portable generator in an enclosed or partially enclosed space, including in your home, or in a garage, basement, crawl space, or other partially enclosed area, even with ventilation. Opening doors and windows or using fans will not prevent CO buildup. Locate a portable generator outdoors and away from doors, windows, and vents that could allow CO to come indoors. Portable generators can produce high levels of deadly CO very quickly. In addition to producing toxic engine exhaust, portable generators can cause electric shock or electrocution and fire. (See Appendix: Portable Generators.)</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_476">What is the best source of information about winter weather? Local radio or television stations or NOAA Weather Radio are the best sources of information about winter weather conditions.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_477">NOAA Weather Radio is the prime alerting and critical information delivery system of the National Weather Service (NWS). NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts warnings, watches, forecasts, and other hazard information 24 hours a day over more than 650 stations in the 50 states, adjacent coastal waters, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific territories.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_478">The NWS encourages people to buy a weather radio equipped with the Specific Area Message Encoder (SAME) feature. This feature automatically alerts you when important information about winter weather and other hazards is issued for your area. Information on NOAA Weather Radio is available from your local NWS office or at www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_479">Wind Chill Temperature. The wind chill temperature is how cold people and animals feel when they are outside. Wind chill is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by wind and cold. As wind increases, heat is carried away from the body at a faster rate. This drives down the body temperature. Therefore, the wind makes it feel much colder. The wind chill temperature is not the actual temperature but rather how wind and cold feel on exposed skin.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_480">Outlook, Watch, Warning, Advisory:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_481">A Winter Storm OUTLOOK means winter storm conditions are possible in the next two to five days. Stay tuned to local media for updates.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_482">A Winter Storm WATCH means winter storm conditions are possible within the next 36 to 48 hours. People in a watch area should review their winter storm plans (Family Disaster Plan, Disaster Supplies Kit) and keep informed about weather conditions.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_483">A Winter Storm WARNING means life-threatening, severe winter conditions have begun or will begin within 24 hours. People in a warning area should take precautions immediately.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_484">A Blizzard WARNING means sustained winds or frequent gusts of 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour or greater and considerable falling or blowing snow that reduces visibility to less than a quarter mile (0.4 kilometer) are expected to prevail for a period of three hours or longer. People in a warning area should take precautions immediately.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_485">A Winter Weather ADVISORY means winter weather conditions are expected to cause significant inconveniences and may be hazardous. If you are cautious, these situations should not be life threatening.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_486">Outlooks, watches, warnings, and advisories are issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) and broadcast on NOAA Weather Radio and on local radio and television stations.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_487">Is your community StormReady? To help people prepare for the ravages of hazardous weather, the National Weather Service has designed StormReady, a program aimed at arming Americaâs communities with the communication and safety skills necessary to save lives and property. More information is available at www.stormready.noaa.gov/.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_488">Carbon Monoxide Alarm.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_489">Every home should have properly installed and maintained carbon monoxide (CO) alarms that meet current safety standards. (See Appendix: Carbon Monoxide Alarms.) CO alarms can help detect CO, a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning any fuel. Exposure to high levels of CO can cause death. The initial symptoms of CO poisoning are similar to the flu and include dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, and irregular breathing.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_490">Be Prepared for a Winter Storm. Protect Yourself. CORE ACTION MESSAGES:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_491">Install and maintain smoke and carbon monoxide alarms.</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_493">Inspect heating equipment and have it serviced as needed.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_494">For general preparedness, every household should create and practice a Family Disaster Plan and assemble and maintain a Disaster Supplies Kit. In addition, every household should take specific precautions and make specific plans for cold weather. If you live in an area where severe winter weather is possible, you should: Talk with members of your household about what to do if a winter storm watch or warning is issued. Discussing winter storms ahead of time helps reduce fear and helps everyone know how to respond during a winter storm.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_495">Install smoke alarms. For new homes, interconnected smoke alarms are required on every level of the home, outside each sleeping area and inside each bedroom. Although this approach is ideal for all homes, as a minimum, existing homes should have smoke alarms on every level and outside each sleeping area. Test and maintain them according to the manufacturerâs instructions. (See Appendix: Smoke Alarms.)</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_496">Install carbon monoxide (CO) alarms following the manufacturerâs instructions. It is especially important to have one near sleeping areas. Test and maintain them according to the manufacturerâs instructions. (See Appendix: Carbon Monoxide Alarms.)</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_502">Make sure your home heating sources are installed according to local codes and permit requirements and are clean and in working order. Many home fires are started by poorly maintained furnaces or stoves, cracked or rusted furnace parts, or chimneys with creosote buildup.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_503">Be sure all portable and fixed electric space heaters have been certified by an independent testing laboratory. Keep blankets, clothing, curtains, furniture, and anything that could get hot and catch fire at least three feet away from all heat sources. Plug heaters directly into the wall socket rather than using an extension cord and unplug them when they are not in use</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_504">Use kerosene heaters only if permitted by law in your area. Refuel kerosene heaters outdoors only after they have cooled. Kerosene has a low flash point. If mistakenly dripped on hot surfaces, it can cause fires. Do not substitute gasoline for kerosene in the heater. Make sure the area is ventilated properly. Follow all of the manufacturerâs instructions.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_505">Have chimneys and wood stoves inspected annually and cleaned if necessary. Chimneys and wood stoves build up creosote, which is the residue left behind by burning wood. Creosote is flammable and needs to be professionally removed periodically. Store ashes in a metal container with a tight-fitting lid.</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_509">Insulate your home and protect the pipes.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_510">If you live in an area where severe winter weather is possible, you should:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_511">Make sure your home is properly insulated. If necessary, insulate the walls and attic to reduce your home's power demands for heat. Caulk and weather-strip doors and windowsills to keep cold air out.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_512">Install storm windows or cover windows with plastic from the inside to provide an extra layer of insulation to keep cold air out.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_513">Protect pipes from freezing by:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_514">Wrapping pipes in insulation or layers of newspaper and then covering them with plastic to keep out moisture.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_515">Letting faucets drip a little.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_516">Know how to shut off the main water valve and how to shut off and drain outside faucets. Outside faucets are often controlled by a valve inside the home. Keep a wrench near the valves.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_517">Install heat tape on water pipes. Put the tape on all exterior water pipes and interior pipes located on outside walls or anywhere else that temperatures could go below freezing. Follow carefully the manufacturerâs instructions for installation.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_518">If the pipes freeze, remove any insulation or newspaper and wrap the pipes in rags. Completely open all faucets and pour hot water over the pipes, starting where they were most exposed to the cold or where the cold most likely penetrated. A hand-held hair dryer, used with caution to prevent overheating, also works well.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_519">Consider buying emergency heating equipment, such as a wood- or coal-burning stove or an electric or kerosene heater. If you have a stove, be sure it is properly vented and in good working order and that you dispose of ashes safely. Keep a supply of wood or coal on hand. If you have an electric space heater, either portable or fixed, be sure it is certified by an independent testing laboratory. Plug a heater directly into the wall socket rather than using an extension cord and unplug it when it is not in use. Use a kerosene heater only if permitted by law in your area; check with your local fire department. If you have a kerosene heater, use only the correct fuel for your unit. Properly ventilate the area of use. Refuel the unit outdoors only, and only when the unit is cool. Follow all of the manufacturer's instructions. Keep all heaters at least three feet away from furniture and other flammable objects.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_520">When using fireplaces, stoves, and space heaters, ventilate properly and guard against fire. Using alternative sources of heat such as these greatly increases your risk for fire and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_521">Consider storing sufficient heating fuel. Regular fuel sources may be cut off. Be cautious of fire hazards when storing any type of fuel.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_522">If you have a fireplace, consider keeping a supply of firewood or coal. Be sure the fireplace is properly vented and in good working order and that you dispose of ashes safely.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_523">Install snow fences in rural areas to reduce drifting snow on roads and paths, which could block access to homes, barns, and animals' feed and water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_524">Create a place where your animals can be comfortable in severe winter weather. Bring your companion animals indoors. Horses and livestock should have a shelter where they can be protected from wind, snow, ice, and rain. Grazing animals should have access to a protected supply of food and non-frozen water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_525">Be aware of the potential for flooding when snow and ice melt and be sure that your animals have access to high ground that is not impeded by fencing or other barriers. You may not be able to get to them in time to relocate them in the event of flooding.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_526">Ensure that any outbuildings that house or shelter animals can withstand wind and heavy snow and ice.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_527">Consider purchasing flood insurance, if you live in a flood-prone area, to cover possible flood damage that may occur during the spring thaw. Homeowners' policies do not cover damage from floods. Ask your insurance agent about the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) if you are at risk. More information on NFIP is available at www.fema.gov/nfip.</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_538">Bring your companion animals inside and ensure that your horses and livestock have blankets if appropriate and unimpeded access to shelter, food, and non-frozen water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_539">What to Do During a Winter Storm Watch. CORE ACTION MESSAGES:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_540">Stay informed.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_541">Shelter animals.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_542">Stay inside if possible.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_543">Stay indoors and wear warm clothes. Layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing will keep you warmer than a bulky sweater. If you feel too warm, remove layers to avoid sweating; if you feel chilled, add layers.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_544">Listen to a local station on battery-powered radio or television or to NOAA Weather Radio for updated emergency information.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_545">Bring your companion animals inside before the storm begins.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_546">Eat regularly. Food provides the body with energy for producing its own heat.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_547">Keep the body replenished with fluids to prevent dehydration. Drink liquids such as warm broth or juice. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine, a stimulant, accelerates the symptoms of hypothermia. Alcohol, such as brandy, is a depressant and hastens the effects of cold on the body. Alcohol also slows circulation and can make you less aware of the effects of cold. Both caffeine and alcohol can cause dehydration.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_548">Conserve fuel. Winter storms can last for several days. Great demand may be placed on electric, gas, and other fuel distribution systems (fuel oil, propane, etc.). Suppliers of propane and fuel oil may not be able to replenish depleted supplies during severe weather. Electric and gas services may be temporarily disrupted when many people demand large amounts at the same time. Lower the thermostat to 65Â° F (18Â° C) during the day and to 55Â° F (13Â° C) at night. Close off unused rooms, and stuff towels or rags in cracks under the doors. Cover the windows at night.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_549">If you must go outside, protect yourself from winter storm hazards:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_550">Wear layered clothing, mittens or gloves, and a hat. Layered clothing will keep you warmer than a single, heavy coat. Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Mittens or gloves and a hat will prevent the loss of body heat. Mittens are warmer than gloves because your fingers maintain more warmth when they touch each other. Half of your body-heat loss is from your head.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_551">Cover your mouth to protect your lungs from severely cold air. Avoid taking deep breaths; minimize talking.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_552">Watch for signs of hypothermia and frostbite. (See Appendix: Frostbite and Hypothermia.)</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_553">Keep dry. Change wet clothing frequently to prevent a loss of body heat. Wet clothing loses much of its insulating value and transmits heat rapidly away from the body.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_554">Stretch before you go out. If you go out to shovel snow, do a few stretching exercises to warm up your body. This will reduce your chances of muscle injury.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_555">Avoid overexertion, such as shoveling heavy snow, pushing a vehicle, or walking in deep snow. The strain from the cold and the hard labor may cause a heart attack.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_556">Sweating could lead to a chill and hypothermia.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_557">Walk carefully on snowy, icy sidewalks. Slips and falls occur frequently in winter weather, resulting in painful and sometimes disabling injuries.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_558">If you must go out during a winter storm, use public transportation if possible. About 70 percent of winter deaths related to ice and snow occur in automobiles.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_559">Check on relatives, neighbors, and friends, particularly if they are elderly or if they live alone.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_560">Driving in Winter Conditions. CORE ACTION MESSAGES:</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_564">You should:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_565">Have your vehicle winterized before the winter storm season. Keeping your vehicle in good condition will decrease your chance of being stranded in cold weather. Have a mechanic check your battery, antifreeze, wipers and windshield washer fluid, ignition system, thermostat, lights, flashing hazard lights, exhaust system, heater, brakes, defroster, and oil level. If necessary, replace existing oil with winter-grade oil. Install good winter tires. Make sure the tires have adequate tread. All-weather radials are usually adequate for most winter conditions. However, some jurisdictions require that vehicles on their roads be equipped with chains or snow tires with studs.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_566">Check your vehicle emergency supplies kit and replenish it if necessary. (See Appendix: Emergency Supplies for Your Vehicle.)</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_567">If you will be driving in wintry conditions, in addition to the usual emergency supplies you keep in your vehicle, be sure to keep enough of the following for each person:</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_585">Be on the lookout for sleet, freezing rain, freezing drizzle, and dense fog, which can make driving very hazardous.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_586">Avoid traveling during a winter storm.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_587">If you must travel and do become stranded, it is better to stay in the vehicle and wait for help. Do not leave the vehicle to search for assistance unless help is visible within 100 yards (91 meters). You can quickly become disoriented and confused in blowing snow.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_588">If you are stuck in a vehicle:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_589">Display a trouble sign to indicate you need help. Hang a brightly colored cloth (preferably red) on the radio antenna and raise the hood after snow stops falling.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_590">Run the engine occasionally to keep warm. Carbon monoxide can build up inside a standing vehicle while the engine is running, even if the exhaust pipe is clear. Running the heater for 10 minutes every hour generally is enough to keep the occupants warm. Running the engine for only short periods reduces the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and conserves fuel. Turn on the engine for about 10 minutes each hour (or five minutes every half hour). Use the heater while the engine is running. Keep the exhaust pipe clear of snow, and slightly open a downwind window for ventilation.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_591">Leave the overhead light on when the engine is running so that you can be seen.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_592">Do light exercises to keep up circulation. Clap your hands and move your arms and legs occasionally. Try not to stay in one position for too long.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_593">If more than one person is in the vehicle, take turns sleeping. One of the first signs of hypothermia is sleepiness. If you are not awakened periodically to increase body temperature and circulation, you can freeze to death.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_594">Huddle together for warmth. Use newspapers, maps, and even the removable floor mats for added insulation. Layering items will help trap more body heat.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_595">Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia. Severe cold can cause numbness, making you unaware of possible danger. Keep fingers and toes moving for circulation, and drink warm broth to reduce the risk of further injury.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_596">Drink fluids to avoid dehydration. Bulky winter clothing can cause you to sweat, but cold dry air will help the sweat evaporate, making you unaware of possible dehydration. When people are dehydrated, they are more susceptible to the ill effects of cold and to heart attacks.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_597">Avoid overexertion. Cold weather puts an added strain on the heart. Unaccustomed exercise, such as shoveling snow or pushing a vehicle, can bring on a heart attack or make other medical conditions worse.</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1063">Smoke Alarms.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1064">If you have a fire, smoke alarms can cut nearly in half your risk of dying in a fire. Smoke alarms sense abnormal amounts of smoke or invisible combustion gases in the air. They can detect both smoldering and flaming fires. National Fire Protection Association 72, the National Fire Alarm Code, now requires in new homes hard-wired, interconnected smoke alarms with battery back-up on every level of the home, outside each sleeping area, and inside each bedroom. It also requires that alarms be wired together so that if one sounds, they all sound.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1065">If smoke alarms are not already in place, at a minimum install them on every level of the home and outside each sleeping area. If a fire occurs inside a bedroom, dangerous gases can cause heavier sleep. For the best protection, install interconnected smoke alarms in each bedroom and throughout the home. When one sounds, they all sound.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1066">To prevent nuisance alarms, vacuum cobwebs and dust from your smoke alarms monthly. Never disable a smoke alarm, even if you experience nuisance alarms while cooking or showering. Clean the smoke alarm following the manufacturerâs instructions and, if possible, relocate it away from the kitchen or bathroom. If nuisance alarms are a persistent problem, look for a different type of smoke alarm.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1067">Use the test button to test your smoke alarms at least monthly. The test feature tests all electronic functions and is safer than testing with a controlled fire (matches, lighters, cigarettes). If the smoke alarm manufacturer's instructions permit the use of an aerosol smoke product for testing the smoke alarm, and you prefer that method, choose one that has been listed (examined and tested to appropriate product safety standards) by a third-party product testing laboratory, and use it in accordance with the product instructions.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1068">If you have battery-powered smoke alarms, replace the batteries at least once a year. (Replace the batteries in your carbon monoxide (CO) alarms at the same time you replace your smoke alarm batteries.) Some agencies recommend that you replace batteries when the time changes from standard to daylight savings each spring and then back again in the fall. "Change your clock, change your batteries." Replacing batteries this often certainly will not hurt; however, data show that fresh batteries will last at least a year, so more frequent replacement is not necessary unless the smoke alarm begins to chirp. Also, Arizona, Hawaii, the eastern portion of Indiana, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam do not use daylight savings time. Pick an easy-to-remember anniversary, such as your birthday or a national holiday, as the day to change the batteries each year.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1069">Replace your smoke alarms every 10 years. This is the recommendation of the National Fire Protection Association and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Smoke alarms become less sensitive over time.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1070">Be sure to install smoke alarms in areas where pets are and in other buildings that house animals where humans can hear them.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1071">Carbon Monoxide Alarms.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1072">Every home should have properly installed and maintained carbon monoxide (CO) alarms. CO alarms can help detect CO, a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning any fuel. Exposure to high levels of CO can cause death. The initial symptoms of CO poisoning are similar to the flu and include dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, and irregular breathing.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1073">Install battery-operated CO alarms or plug-in CO alarms with battery back-up in your home, according to the manufacturerâs installation instructions. CO alarms should be certified to the requirements of the latest safety standards for CO alarms (UL 2034, IAS 6-96, or CSA 6.19.01). It is especially important to have a CO alarm near sleeping areas.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1074">Test and maintain your CO alarms according to the manufacturerâs instructions.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1075">If your carbon monoxide (CO) alarm sounds, immediately move to a fresh air location and call for help. Remain in the fresh air location until emergency personnel say it is ok.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1076">Because of the risk of CO poisoning, never operate unvented fuel-burning appliances in any closed room or where people or animals are sleeping. CO poisoning from fuel-burning appliances kills people in the United States each year.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1077">CO can leak from faulty furnaces or fuel-fired heaters or can be trapped inside a home by a blocked chimney or flue. Burning charcoal inside a home produces CO. Running an automobile engine in an attached garage can cause CO to enter a home and so can running a portable generator if it is near windows, doors, or vents, even if it is outdoors.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1078">Never use gas appliances such as ranges, ovens, or clothes dryers for heating your home. Never use a portable generator in an enclosed or partially enclosed space, including in your home or in a garage, basement, crawl space, or other partially enclosed area, even with ventilation. Locate a generator outdoors and away from doors, windows, and vents that could allow CO to come indoors. Generators can produce high levels of deadly CO very quickly. (See Appendix: Portable Generators.)</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1079">Fire Extinguishers.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1080">Consider having one or more working fire extinguishers in your home. An extinguisher rated âA-B-Câ is recommended for home use. Many fire extinguisher models are designed for one-time use and cannot be recharged.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1081">Get training from the fire department or a fire extinguisher manufacturer on how to use your fire extinguisher. Fire extinguishers from various manufacturers operate in different ways. Unless you know how to use your extinguisher, you may not be able to use it effectively, or it could place you in greater danger. There is no time to read directions during an emergency. Only adults should handle and use extinguishers.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1082">Install extinguishers high on the wall, near an exit, and away from heat sources. Extinguishers should be easily accessible to adults trained to use them, and kept away from children's curious hands. Heat may make the contents less effective or cause the extinguisher to lose its charge more quickly.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1083">If you try to use a fire extinguisher on a fire and the fire does not immediately die down, drop the extinguisher and get out. Most portable extinguishers empty in 8 seconds.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1084">Look at your fire extinguisher to ensure that it is properly charged. Fire extinguishers will not work properly if they are not properly charged. Use the gauge or test button to check that there is proper pressure. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for replacing or recharging fire extinguishers. If the unit is low on pressure, damaged, or corroded, replace it or have it professionally serviced.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1085">Before you begin to fight a fire with a fire extinguisher, be sure that:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1086">Everyone has left or is leaving the home.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1087">The fire department has been called.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1088">The fire is small and not spreading.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1089">Your back is to an exit you can use quickly.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1090">There is not much smoke in the room.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1091">Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCIs).</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1092">Consider installing AFCIs in your homeâs electrical panel box. Problems in home wiring, like arcing and sparking, are associated with more then 40,000 home fires each year. The Consumer Product Safety Commissions reports that these fires claim over 350 lives and injure 1400 victims annually. An arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) is provides enhanced protection from fires resulting from these unsafe home wiring conditions. They detect abnormal arcing in a circuit (which can cause overheating and lead to an electrical fire) and de-energize the circuit when an arc fault is detected. AFCIs are recognized for their effectiveness and now required by the National Electric CodeÂ® for bedroom circuits in new construction. Older homes with ordinary circuit breakers especially may benefit from the added protection against the arcing faults that can occur in aging wire systems. Be certain to have a qualified electrician install AFCIs. This installation involved working within electrical panel boxes that are usually live; even with the main circuit breakers turned off.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1093">AFCIs should not be confused with ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCI). While both AFCIs and GFCIs are important safety devices, they have different functions. The popular GFCI devices are designed to protect people against severe or fatal electric shock, not fire hazards. GFCIs can protect against some electrical fires by detecting faults to ground but cannot detect hazardous âacross-the-lineâ arcing faults that can cause fires. The National Electric CodeÂ® requires GFCI protection for receptacles located outdoors, in bathrooms, garages, kitchens, crawl spaces and unfinished basements; and at certain locations such as near swimming pools.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1094">Home Fire Sprinkler Systems.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1095">Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your home. Although smoke alarms are essential in every household, they are designed to detect, not control, a fire. Home fire sprinklers complement the alarms' work, providing a way to fight flames immediately. In less time than it would take the fire department to arrive on the scene, home fire sprinklers can prevent a fire from spreading and even extinguish a fire. A sprinkler system can decrease the chance that deadly smoke and gases will reach your family. In addition, sprinkler systems can put out fire when you are away from home, and if they are connected to an alarm system, may notify the fire department in your absence.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1096">To ensure sprinkler system reliability, be sure to use a qualified installer who adheres to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes and standards and local fire safety regulations.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1097">Portable Generators.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1098">Portable generators are useful when temporary or remote electric power is needed, but they also can be hazardous. The primary hazards to avoid when using a generator are carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning from the toxic engine exhaust, electric shock or electrocution, and fire. Every year, people die in incidents related to portable generator use.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1099">Carbon Monoxide Hazard:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1100">Never use a portable generator in an enclosed or partially enclosed space. Portable generators can produce high levels of CO very quickly. When you use a portable generator, remember that you cannot smell or see CO. Even if you cannot smell exhaust fumes, you may still be exposed to CO. If you start to feel sick, dizzy, or weak while using a portable generator, get to fresh air right away. Alert others in the home or in the vicinity to get to fresh air. Do not delay. The CO from portable generators can rapidly lead to full incapacitation and death.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1101">If you experience serious symptoms, get medical attention immediately. Inform medical staff that CO poisoning is suspected. If you experienced symptoms while indoors, have someone call the fire department to determine when it is safe to reenter the building.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1102">Follow these safety tips to protect against CO poisoning:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1103">Never use a portable generator indoors, including in homes, garages, basements, crawl spaces, and other enclosed or partially enclosed areas, even with ventilation. Opening doors and windows or using fans will not prevent CO buildup.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1104">Follow the instructions that come with your portable generator. Locate the unit outdoors and away from doors, windows, and vents that could allow CO to come indoors.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1105">Install battery-operated CO alarms or plug-in CO alarms with battery back-up in your home, according to the manufacturerâs installation instructions.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1106">Electrical Hazards.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1107">Follow these tips to protect against electrical hazards:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1108">Keep the portable generator dry and do not use it where it could get wet by rain or snow. To protect it from moisture, operate it on a dry surface under an open, canopy-like structure. Dry your hands if they are wet before touching the generator.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1109">Plug appliances directly into the portable generator. Or, use a heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cord that is rated (in watts or amps) at least equal to the sum of the connected appliance loads. Check that the entire cord is free of cuts or tears and that the plug has all three prongs, especially a grounding pin.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1110">Never try to power the home wiring by plugging the portable generator into a wall outlet, a practice known as âbackfeedingâ This is an extremely dangerous practice that presents an electrocution risk to utility workers and neighbors served by the same utility transformer. It also bypasses some of the built-in household circuit protection devices.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1111">If you must connect a portable generator to the home wiring to power appliances, have a qualified electrician install the appropriate equipment in accordance with local electrical codes. Or, check with your utility company to see if it can install an appropriate power transfer switch.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1112">For power outages, permanently installed stationary generators are better suited for providing backup power to a home. Even a properly connected portable generator can become overloaded. This may result in overheating or stressing the generator components, possibly leading to a generator failure.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1113">Fire Hazards.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1114">Follow these tips to protect against fire hazards:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1115">Never store fuel for your portable generator in the home. Gasoline, propane, kerosene, and other flammable liquids should be stored outside of living areas in properly labeled, non-glass, safety containers. Do not store them near a fuel-burning appliance, such as a natural gas water heater in a garage. If the fuel is spilled or the container is not sealed properly, invisible vapors from the fuel can travel along the ground and can be ignited by the applianceâs pilot light or by arcs from electric switches in the appliance.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1116">Before refueling a portable generator, turn it off and let it cool down. Gasoline spilled on hot engine parts could ignite.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1117">Tips for Preparing Your Disaster Supplies Kits.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1118">Keep items in separate airtight plastic bags. This will help protect them from damage or spoiling.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1119">Observe the expiration or âuse byâ date on stored food and water. If you have prepared you own containers of water, replace them every six months to ensure freshness.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1120">Rethink your kit and family needs at least once a year. Replace batteries, update medicines, clothes, etc.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1121">Ask your physician or pharmacist about storing prescription medications. You may find that the best solution is to gradually acquire a reserve by refilling prescriptions a little early, but always using those on hand first to avoid having the expiration dates lapse. Be sure they are stored to meet instructions on the label. It may be difficult to obtain prescription medications during a disaster because stores may be closed or supplies may be limited. Keep copies of essential prescriptions with you at all times.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1122">Use easy-to-carry containers for the supplies you would most likely need for an evacuation. Label them clearly. Think about using:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1123">Large trash container with handles and a cover</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1124">Camping backpack</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1128">Store water separately to prevent damage from leakage.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1129">Always keep your cell phone with you, if you have one. Do not pack it in the kit. Consider getting an extra cell phone battery to keep with your Disaster Supplies Kit.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1130">Emergency Supplies for Your Vehicle.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1131">In addition to the basic vehicle safety itemsâproperly inflated spare tire, wheel wrench, and jackâyou should also keep a smaller version of your disaster supplies kit (see Disaster Supplies Kit) and a first aid kit (see Appendix: First Aid Kit) in your vehicle. Include local maps where you drive, basic tools (pliers, adjustable wrench, screwdriver, etc.), flashlight and extra batteries, duct tape, reflective triangle, signal flares, a roll of quarters for making phone calls and vending machines, and essential fluids (oil, coolant and transmission fluid). Rags are helpful to wipe up fluid or cleaning grime off your hands. You may also consider having a fire extinguisher, jumper cables, bottled water, nonperishable food, medications, toilet tissue and premoistened towelettes in case you breakdown or are stuck. Check your vehicle supplies regularly for expired or unusable items.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1132">When driving in winter or cold climates, add a windshield scraper, snow brush, salt, sand, shovel, tire chains and warm clothing. Blankets or sleeping bags will keep you</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1133">warm and can also be used to cover the ground if you need to get near the ground to make repairs or change a tire. Extra socks and shoes are helpful if your feet get wet or you are wearing non-waterproof shoes.</bu>

Because the storage requirements of prescription drugs vary, some may have to be added to the kit at the last minute. You may want to pin or tape a note to the outside of your kit container reminding you to take along prescription drugs if you have to evacuate.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1162">Foods to Stock at Home and in Your Disaster Supplies Kit.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1163">Even though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your food supply for two weeks, consider maintaining a supply in your home that will last that long. The easiest way to develop a two-week stockpile is to increase the amount of basic foods you normally keep on your shelves. Check expiration dates frequently and follow the practice of first-in, first-out.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1164">Pack at least a three-day supply of nonperishable food and water in your Disaster Supplies Kit to be used incase you need to evacuate. Three days worth of supplies should be enough to get you to a location that has additional supplies. This may be outside the impacted area. You need to have these items packed and ready in case there is no time to gather food from the kitchen when disaster strikes. Include both compact, lightweight items like dehydrated foods, which are easy to carry if you must evacuate, and canned foods like fruit, juices, and vegetables that supply a source of water. Choose foods that require no refrigeration, preparation, or cooking. If you must heat food, pack a can of cooking fuel, such as used for camping. Do not pack gasoline, kerosene, or propane.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1165">Familiar foods can lift morale and help people feel secure in time of stress. Try to include foods that everyone will enjoy. Look for foods high in calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Look for canned foods with high liquid content in case water is scarce.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1166">Specifically, consider packing:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1167">Ready-to-eat canned meats, fruits, and vegetables.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1168">Canned juice, milk, and soup.</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1184">If your water supply is limited, you should avoid eating foods that are high in fat and protein, even if they are part of your emergency supply, because they require more water for the body to metabolize.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1185">Commercially dehydrated foods often require a lot of water for reconstitution and effort to prepare.</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1195">Storing Water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1196">Having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergency. The following guidelines will help you ensure that members of your household have sufficient water in an emergency situation:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1197">Keep at least a three-day supply of water, that is, a minimum of three gallons per person. It is strongly recommended that you store more if possible. Each person should have one-half gallon per day for drinking and one-half gallon for cooking and sanitation. A normally active person needs to drink at least one-half gallon of water each day. Hot environments and intense physical activity can double that amount. Children, nursing mothers, and ill people will also need more. Be sure to include drinking and clean-up water for your pets. The amount needed will depend on their sizes and the conditions. Remember that pets often drink more water than usual when under stress.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1198">To prepare the safest and most reliable emergency supply of water, purchase commercially bottled water. Keep bottled water in its original container and do not open it until you need to use it.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1199">Store bottled water in the original sealed container and observe the expiration or âuse byâ date.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1200">If you are preparing your own containers of water, follow the directions below for selecting, cleaning, and filling the containers with water:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1201">Purchase food-grade, water-storage containers from surplus or camping supplies stores to use for water storage.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1202">If you chose to use your own storage containers, chose two-liter, plastic soda bottlesânot plastic jugs or cardboard containers that have had milk or fruit juice in them. Milk protein and fruit sugars cannot be adequately removed from these containers and provide an environment for bacterial growth when water is stored in them.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1203">Do not use glass containers because they can break and are heavy.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1204">Do not use cardboard containers, because they can leak easily. These containers are not designed for long-term storage of liquids.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1205">If storing water in plastic soda bottles or food-grade, water-storage containers, follow these steps:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1206">Thoroughly clean them with dishwashing soap and water, and rinse them completely so there is no residual soap.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1207">Sanitize them and their caps by adding a solution of 1 teaspoon of non-scented liquid household chlorine bleach to a quart of water. Swish the sanitizing solution in the containers and caps so that it touches all interior surfaces. After sanitizing the containers and caps, thoroughly rinse out the sanitizing solution with clean water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1208">To fill water containers:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1209">Fill them to the top with regular tap water. If the tap water has been commercially treated from a water utility with chlorine, you do not need to add anything else to the water to keep it clean. If the water you are using comes from a well or water source that is not treated with chlorine, add two drops of non-scented liquid household chlorine bleach to the water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1210">Tightly close the containers using the original caps. Be careful not to contaminate the caps by touching the inside of them with your fingers.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1211">Place a date on the outside of the containers so that you know when you filled them. Store them in a cool, dark place.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1212">Replace the water every six months if not using commercially bottled water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1213">Store your three-day supply in a handy place. You need to have water packed and ready in case there is no time to fill water bottles when disaster strikes.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1214">Drinking Water Safety.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1215">Listen to a local radio or television station for announcements from appropriate authorities about the safety of drinking water. Follow their directions.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1216">You can drink water from the community water system unless you have been told or have reason to suspect it has become contaminated.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1217">If the water is contaminated:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1218">Use your emergency supply of water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1219">Purchase bottled water, if necessary, until you are certain that your water supply is safe.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1220">Consider all water from wells, cisterns, and other delivery systems in the disaster area to be unsafe until tested.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1221">Water from melted ice cubes made before the disaster occurred is generally safe to drink.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1222">Water from undamaged hot water tanks and water pipes is generally safe to drink. Turn off the main water valve before draining water from these sources.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1223">Bottled juices and the liquid from canned fruits and vegetables are another source of water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1224">If you need to find drinking water outside your home, you can use rainwater; streams, rivers, and other moving bodies of water; ponds and lakes; and natural springs. If you question its purity, be sure to treat the water first. (See below.) Avoid water with floating material, an odor, or a dark color. Use saltwater only if you distill it first. Do NOT drink floodwater.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1225">Treating Water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1226">Treat water for drinking, cooking, and bathing only if it is of questionable quality. There are several ways to treat waterâbut none is perfect. Often, the best solution is a combination of methods.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1227">Boiling is the safest method of treating water. Strain water through a clean cloth to remove bulk impurities. Bring water to a rolling boil for about one full minute. Let the water cool before drinking. Boiled water will taste better if you put oxygen back into it by pouring the water back and forth between two clean containers. This will also improve the taste of stored water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1228">Household liquid bleach can kill microorganisms in water. Use chlorine bleach from a freshly opened bottle. Use only regular household liquid bleach that contains approximately 5.25 to 6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, color-safe bleaches, or bleaches with added cleaners. Add 1/8 teaspoon (approximately 0.75 mL or 8 drops) of newly purchased, unscented liquid household bleach per gallon of water. Stir the water well, and let it stand for 30 minutes before you use it. If the water is cloudy or extremely cold, or the bleach label says there is less than 4% sodium hypochlorite in the product, double the amount of bleach you add to the water. Using bleach will not kill parasitic organisms. Other chemicals, such as iodine or water treatment products sold in camping or surplus stores that do not contain 5.25 to 6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, are not recommended and should not be used. Distilling removes salt and other solid impurities from water. Distillation involves boiling water and then collecting the vapor that condenses back to water. The condensed vapor will not include salt or other solid impurities. A relatively simple, although inefficient, way to distill water in an emergency is to suspend a cup over boiling water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1229">(See Appendix: Food and Water Exposed to Floodwater, Fire, and Chemicals.).</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1230">Keeping Refrigerated Food Safe if the Power Goes Out.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1231">The loss of power from high wind, fire, flood, or even a traffic accident can be sudden. Without power to run your refrigerator and freezer, the safety of your food could be a concern. Be prepared for an emergency by keeping on hand items that do not require refrigeration, such as shelf-stable food, boxed or canned milk, and canned goods. (See Appendix: Tips for Preparing Your Disaster Supplies Kits.) Make sure you have pre-prepared baby formula for infants, if needed. Remember to use these items in the order you bought them and replace them from time to time.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1232">Knowing ways for keeping food safe when the power goes out will help reduce the worry about what is safe to eat and minimize the potential loss of food. The following information will help you make the right decisions for keeping your family safe:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1233">Always keep your refrigerator at or below 40Â° F (4Â° C). Keep your freezer at or below 0Â° F (-18Â°C). An appliance thermometer can tell you if your refrigerator and freezer are at the proper temperatures.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1234">If the power goes out, keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to maintain the cold temperatures. An unopened refrigerator will keep food safely cold for about four hours. A full freezer will stay sufficiently cold for about 48 hours (24 hours if it is half full) if it is unopened.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1235">If your freezer is not full, keep items close togetherâthis helps the food stay cold longer.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1236">Keep frozen meat and poultry items on the lowest (coldest) shelf of the freezer, and separated from other food so that thawing meat or poultry juices will not contaminate the other food.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1237">Obtain dry or block ice to keep your refrigerator as cold as possible if the power is going to be out for a prolonged period of time.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1238">If you are not sure a particular food is cold enough, take its temperature with the food thermometer. Discard any perishable foods (such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and leftovers) that have been above 40Â° F (4Â° C) for two hours or more, and any food that has an unusual odor, color, or texture, or feels warm to the touch.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1239">Be sure to discard any fully cooked items in either the freezer or the refrigerator that have come in contact with raw meat juices.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1240">Remember, you cannot rely solely on appearance or odor. Never taste food to determine its safety. Some foods may look and smell fine, but if they have been at room temperature too long, bacteria that cause food-borne illness can begin to grow very rapidly. Some types of bacteria produce toxins that are not destroyed by cooking.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1241">If previously frozen food is partially or completely thawed when the power comes back on:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1242">You can safely refreeze it if it contains ice crystals or is at 40Â° F (4Â° C) or below. You will have to evaluate each item separately.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1243">Partially thawed food can be refrozen safely, but refreezing may reduce the quality of some food.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1244">Raw meats and poultry from the freezer can be refrozen without too much quality loss.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1245">Prepared food, vegetables, and fruits can be refrozen, but there may be some quality loss.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1246">Fruit juices can be refrozen safely without much quality loss, but frozen fruit will become mushy.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1247">Food from the refrigerator and freezer are not safe outdoors, even in cold weather or snow because:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1248">Frozen food can thaw if it is exposed to the sun's rays.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1249">Refrigerated food may become too warm and food-borne bacteria could grow.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1250">The outdoor temperature could vary hour by hour, and the temperature outdoors would not be satisfactory to protect both refrigerated and frozen foods at the same time. For example, if the outdoor temperature is 25Â° F (-4Â° C), it is too cold for refrigerated food and too warm for frozen food.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1251">Perishable items would be exposed to unsanitary conditions and to animals that may be attracted to the food. Animals are not clean and may harbor disease. Never use food that has come in contact with an animal.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1252">Instead of putting food outdoors, consider taking advantage of the cold by making ice. Fill buckets, empty milk cartons, or cans with water and leave them outside to freeze. Then put the homemade ice in your refrigerator and freezer or coolers.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1253">Food and Water Exposed to Floodwater, Fire, and Chemicals.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1254">After a flood, you should:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1255">Wear gloves, boots, and a long-sleeved shirt and long pants when cleaning up.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1256">Discard all food or drinking water that came in contact with floodwater, including canned goods. It is impossible to know if containers were damaged and the seal compromised.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1257">Discard wooden spoons and cutting boards, plastic utensils, and baby bottle nipples and pacifiers if they have been covered by floodwater. There is no way to safely clean them.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1258">Thoroughly wash metal pans, ceramic dishes and utensils that have been covered by floodwater with hot soapy water and sanitize them by boiling them in clean or properly treated water or by immersing them for 15 minutes in a solution of 1 teaspoon of chlorine bleach per quart of water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1259">Consider what you can do ahead of time to keep your food safe in an emergency. For example, if you live in a location that could be affected by a flood, plan your food storage so that your appliances and food shelves will be safely out of the way of floodwater. And remember to store pet food where it will be safe from possible contamination by floodwater.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1260">After a fire, you should:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1261">Throw out food and water exposed to fire because they may have been damaged by the heat, smoke, and fumes of the fire and by the chemicals used to fight the fire.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1262">Throw out food and water in cans or jars even if they appear to be undamaged, because the heat from a fire can activate spoilage bacteria and make the food and water unsafe.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1263">Throw out any raw food or food in permeable packagingâcardboard, plastic wrap, screw-topped jars and bottles, etc., even if it was stored in the refrigerator.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1264">Throw out any food that has an off-flavor or odor when it is prepared.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1265">Toxic gases released from burning materials are very dangerous. These gases can kill; they can also contaminate food and water. Food and water stored in refrigerators or freezers can also become contaminated by gases. The refrigerator seal is not airtight and gases can get inside.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1266">If food or water has been exposed to toxic chemicals, throw it away. The chemicals cannot be washed off the food. This includes food stored at room temperature, such as fruits and vegetables, as well as food in permeable containers like cardboard and screw-topped jars and bottles, even if it is in the refrigerator. Canned goods are the only foods that can be safely kept after exposure to chemicals and then only if the unopened cans are washed with a dishwashing detergent and then immersed in a bleach solution (1 teaspoon of bleach per quart of water).</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1267">If cookware and utensils have been exposed to toxic chemicals, wash them with dishwashing detergent and then immerse them in a bleach solution (1 teaspoon of bleach per quart of water).</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1268">What to Do if Evacuation Is Necessary Because of a Storm.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1269">If you are advised to evacuate or if you think it is appropriate to evacuate, you should:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1270">Leave as soon as possible, preferably in daylight. Avoid flooded roads and watch for washed-out bridges. Evacuation will probably take longer than expected. Give yourself plenty of time.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1271">Secure your home by unplugging appliances and turning off the electricity and the main water valve. This will reduce potential damage to your appliances from power surges and to your home.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1272">Tell someone outside the storm area where you are goingâ(the out-of-town contact you identified in your Family Disaster Plan). Relatives and friends will be concerned about your safety. Letting someone know your travel plans will help relieve their fear and anxiety.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1273">If time permits and you live in an identified surge zone or area prone to flooding, move furniture to a higher floor. Moving valuable furnishings helps reduce the potential for damage.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1274">Bring your Disaster Supplies Kit, including warm protective clothing. People frequently arrive at shelters or hotels with nothing. Having these items with you will make you more comfortable. While shelters provide a safe place to stay and food, specialty items for infants and individuals on restricted diets may not be available. It may be several days before permission is given by local authorities to reenter an evacuated area.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1275">Lock your home and leave. There may be individuals evacuating after you, or returning before you. Police may be busy with storm-related emergencies and not able to patrol neighborhoods as usual.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1276">What to Do When There Is Flooding.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1277">If you are outdoors, you should:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1278">Stay out of areas subject to flooding. Dips, low spots, canyons, washes, etc. can become filled with water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1279">Climb to high ground and stay there. Move away from dangerous floodwater.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1280">If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles, stop, turn around, and go another way. Never try to walk, swim, or drive through swift water. Many flood fatalities are caused by people attempting to drive through water, or people playing in high water. If it is moving swiftly, even water six inches (15 centimeters) deep can sweep you off your feet.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1281">If you are driving, you should:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1282">Avoid already flooded areas and areas subject to sudden flooding. Do not attempt to cross flowing streams. Many flood fatalities are caused by people attempting to drive through water or by people playing in high water. The depth of water is not always obvious. The roadbed may be washed out under the water, and you could be stranded or trapped. Also, standing water may be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines. Rapidly rising water may stall he engine, engulf the vehicle and its occupants, and sweep them away. Look out for flooding at highway dips, bridges, and low areas. As little as six inches of water may cause you to lose control of your vehicle and two feet (0.6 meters) of water will carry away most vehicles, including SUVs and pickup trucks.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1283">Stay away from underpasses. Underpasses can fill rapidly with water, while the adjacent roadway remains clear. Driving into an underpass can quickly put you in five to six feet (1.5 to 1.8 meters) of water.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1284">Turn around and find another route if you come upon rapidly rising water. Move to higher ground away from rivers, streams, creeks, and storm drains. If your route is blocked by floodwater or barricades, find another route. Barricades are put up by local officials to protect people from unsafe roads. Driving around them can be a serious risk.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1285">âWind Safeâ Room.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1286">A "wind safeâ room is a reinforced area of a home designed to withstand severe windstorms. While basements offer some protection from damaging winds, the level of protection can be increased greatly by building a reinforced shelter area in a basement, or constructing a shelter in an above-ground room such as an interior closet or a small study room.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1287">An effective âwind safeâ room must be strong enough to survive extreme wind speeds and the impact of airborne debris, sufficiently affordable to appeal to homeowners, and accessible quickly in the event a severe storm approaches. âWind safeâ rooms are easiest to install when a home is being built; however, they can also be added to many existing homes. A variety of options exists for homes with basements, homes built on a "slab-on-grade" foundation, and homes with a "crawlspace" foundation. Typical costs range from $2,000 for a simple "lean-to" shelter in a new-home basement, to $6,000 or more for an above-ground, steel-sheathing shelter.</bu>

<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1291">Emergency Sanitation.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1292">In many shelters during an emergency, people will need to use improvised, emergency toilets if the water supply has been cut off. These kinds of toilets consist of any watertight container with a snug-fitting cover.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1293">Use a garbage container, pail, or bucket.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1294">If the container is small, keep a large container (also with a cover) available for waste disposal.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1295">If possible, line both containers with plastic bags.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1296">Every time the emergency toilet is used, pour or sprinkle a small amount of regular household disinfectant, such as creosol or chlorine bleach, into the container to reduce odors and germs.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1297">After each use, replace the lid.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1298">Frostbite and Hypothermia.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1299">Frostbite and hypothermia are cold-related emergencies that may quickly become life or limb threatening. Preventing cold-related emergencies includes not starting an activity in, on, or around cold water unless you know you can get help quickly in an emergency. Be aware of the wind chill. Dress appropriately and avoid staying in the cold too long. Wear a hat and gloves when appropriate with layers of clothing. Drink plenty of warm fluids or warm water but avoid caffeine and alcohol. Stay active to maintain body heat. Take frequent breaks from the cold. Avoid unnecessary exposure of any part of the body to the cold. Get out of the cold immediately if the signals of hypothermia or frostbite appear.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1300">Frostbite is the freezing of a specific body part such as fingers, toes, the nose or earlobes.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1301">Signals of frostbite include: lack of feeling in the affected area; skin that appears waxy, is cold to the touch, or is discolored (flushed, white or gray, yellow or blue).</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1302">What to do for frostbite:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1303">1. Move the person to a warm place.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1304">2. Handle the area gently; never rub the affected area.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1305">3. Warm gently by soaking the affected area in warm water (100â105 degrees F) until it appears red and feels warm.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1306">4. Loosely bandage the area with dry, sterile dressings.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1307">5. If the personâs fingers or toes are frostbitten, place dry, sterile gauze between them to keep them separated.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1308">6. Avoid breaking any blisters.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1309">7. do not allow the affected area to refreeze.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1310">8. Seek professional medical care as soon as possible.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1311">Hypothermia is another cold-related emergencies. Hypothermia may quickly become life threatening. Hypothermia is caused by the cooling of the body caused by the failure of the bodyâs warming system. The goals of first aid are to restore normal body temperature and to care for any conditions while waiting for EMS personnel.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1312">Signals of hypothermia include: shivering, numbness, glassy stare; apathy, weakness, impaired judgment; loss of consciousness.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1313">What to do for hypothermi:</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1314">1. CALL 9-1-1 or the local emergency number.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1315">2. Gently move the person to a warm place.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1316">3. Monitor breathing and circulation.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1317">4. Give rescue breathing and CPR if needed.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1318">5. Remove any wet clothing and dry the person.</bu>
<bu cl="txt" xid="id_1319">6. Warm the person slowly by wrapping in blankets or by putting dry clothing on the person. Hot water bottles and chemical hot packs may be used when first wrapped in a towel or blanket before applying. Do not warm the person too quickly, such as by immersing him or her in warm water. Rapid warming may cause dangerous heart arrhythmias. warm the core first (trunk, abdomen), not the extremities (hands, feet).

<bu xid="id_11194">README 1st: The first bullet (actually a sub-clip)  contains streaming video from Youtube. 
On Android the native Android Video- player gave best result. Others might show erratic behavior. You might try out which video-player gives decent results. 
The video's in the last 2 Clip-bullets can only be viewed when you have an on-board server The video must first be downloaded from Dropbox at http://db.tt/edEJFi4y and must be dropped in the web-document-root (: the same place where all the cje-files reside).
These video's were found somewhere in the past and I  couldn't found them anymore so I placed them for download here at Dropbox, but all credits go to the British Red Cross at www.redcross.org.uk. There is NOT ANY affiliation between Calamity Jane Express Â® and the British Red Cross.</bu>
<bu xid="id_11195">README 1st: Here are some examples of podcast-streams found on archive.org.
Bullets with a *-mark can only be played when you have the developers version and a local on-board server. The video's can then be downloaded from archive.com with the same titles as given in the bullet-name or one can do a search on "disaster".
situation were the only way to return is the browsers Back-button, after you listened to the podcast. </bu>
<bu xid="id_11196">README 1st: Here are some pics from wikipedia.org that must be download from Dropbox at http://db.tt/CcYFzgDe, so that it can be viewed(in png and jpg format).</bu>
<bu xid="id_11198">README 1st: These are so-calledYahoo Pipes in which data that might come from different sites canbe filtered, added, grouped, sorted etc before they are output in some format and, if needed, further processed by the user. Here the output is in json format for further processing. If you want to do it yourself, please see bullet "Learn more about Yahoo Pipes and rss".
Actually it's a way of providing external/remote functionality: if you don't have the functionality on-board, than it can be "outsourced" to an external source and you get only the result back to you.</bu>

<bu xid="id_11200">README 1st: These are files from FEMA in epub format so that you can read it with special e-reader software. The **-marks mean that of this moment it can only be viewed if you simulate this whole web-app on a desktop/laptop. On a smartphone/tablet it will show you garbled data because the epub format will not automatically fire up an e-reader app. In future versions it should also be possible to start ANY native app and/or open ANY filetype from this "bui" (:bulleted-user-interface), so that EVERYTHING can be opened/started from here.
The files are from Fema and are only converted here, at my site into epub-format, to make it readable with an e-reader hardware/software.
Credits go to Fema at www.fema.gov. There is NOT ANY affiliation between Calamity Jane Express Â® and Fema.</bu>

<bu xid="id_11248">Here you read the latest news or "must read" tips before you start (e.g. for the first time), to get the best experience.
For example that the best and smooth behavior (on my mobile Samsung GS2 plus Android 2.3.6) came surprisingly from a mobile-browser outsider: Dolphin (dolphin.com). Other mobile browsers gave (unfortunately and unexpected actually) erratic behavior especially during drag/drop (Firefox Mobile) in combination with scrolling (Opera Mobile), but hopefully that will be solved in future versions. Other well known mobile browsers couldn't be tested because they couldn't be installed on my mobile Samsung GS2, like Chrome, Safari Mobile and Windows Mobile. But might  you have other experiences, then the please let me know.
You must also use CJE's own "back" button as much as possible, because the historical track of CJE and that of your browser are different. The only combinations that did things smooth and right all the time were, like said, Dolphin Mobile browser in combination with Androids native Videos-player (if watching videos), at least on my Samsung GS2 with Android 2.3.6. But expect things to improve in future versions... (?)</bu>
