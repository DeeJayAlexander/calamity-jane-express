Very initial design of a bulleted-user-interface or "bui", with freely relocatable "bullets" (=JQuery list-items) that can be dragged/dropped within and between "clips" (=JQuery listviews) and especially, but not only, made for mobile devices. It is part of a web-app with an appropriate (to be build) emergency "hit-and-run" federated/p2p web-based framework.

Instructions:
All files in the document-root are read only except cjea.xml and cjeb.xml, that will be written to from the executable script cje.sh in cgi-bin. All files in cgi-bin must be read and written to, except the script cje.sh that must be readable and executable.

THE CALAMITY JANE EXPRESS(R) project (only part of the concept provided).
I've designed/written (and still am designing/writing) a new kind of web-based user-interface especially for (small screen) mobiles but it could easily be ported to any screen-size device and it is called a bulleted-user-interface or "bui". At the heart of this "bui" are bullet-shaped JQuery-based list-items that can freely be relocated within and between JQuery-based listviews (here called clips). Those "bullets" should be able to represent anything, either (passive) data(pieces) or (executable) (app)functions. They can freely be grouped, mixed, multiplied and related to one another and can come from anywhere, local or remote. As of this moment only "clips" can be in a (hierarchical) relationship with one another. The content that populates these "bullets" are "flown-in" via AJAX-protocol from an on-board web-server that uses CGI/CLI scripts. 
In this concept the user can now compose his/her own web-based apps on-the-fly by picking any function on-the-fly and of course also the data-pieces can simply be picked from anywhere and this all by just tap/drag/drop/sweep. And they all can also work on a common canvas to show/manipulate the data (if allowed so by the owner). At least, that is the whole intention of this project and the first open source alpha-version is already publicly available.

- The open source web-app as alpha development version can be found at: github.com/deejayalexander/calamity-jane-express ; when on this website, press on "zip", middle-left on the screen, to download all in 1 zipfile.
- Or it can be viewed online with limitations in functionality (actually meant for smartphone, but can be viewed on a desktop with the latest/best W3C-compatible browsers) at: www.calamityjaneexpress.net.
- There is also a video based impression of how this bulleted-user-interface works, on a Dropbox-link:  http://db.tt/CcYFzgDe (it must be used as follows: copy/paste this link in an email addressed to one-self. When received, one should click on it and then look into the map "video" and download it with upper-right button).

It must be said that on the smartphone, as of this moment, only the Dolphin Mobile browser (9.3.2+) acted like expected at all times. Other browsers showed every now and then certain erratic behavior or didn't work at all at moments. On the desktop Firefox 18+ and Google Chrome 26.0.1410.63+ should do the job. I've no experience with other desktop browsers.

Constructive suggestions of any kind are of course always welcome.
