WHEN A (POTENTIAL) DISASTER IS ABOUT TO STRIKE, THE AFFECTED AREA AND PEOPLE IN IT MIGHT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, BE COMPLETELY BEYOND THE REACH AND/OR CAPACITY OF EMERGENCY WORKERS FROM PRIVATE AND/OR GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.

STUDIES HOWEVER, SHOWES THAT PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY NOT HELPLESS OR PANICKY RUN AROUND LIKE "CHICKEN LITTLE" AT FOREHAND. ON THE CONTRARY, WHEN SOME DISASTER IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, IS HAPPENING OR HAS JUST HAPPENED, PEOPLE OFTEN TAKE ACTIONS TO HELP THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER, LONG BEFORE PROFESIONAL EMERGENCY WORKERS ENTER THE SCENE, IF EVER.

WHAT THE PEOPLE OFTEN LACK, IS A GOOD INFORMATIONSYSTEM AMONG THEMSELVES THAT IS ABLE TO INFORM THEM OF POSSIBLE THREATS, NEEDS AND RESOURCES/HELP, INDEPENDENT OF THE DEFAULT INFORMATIONSYSTEM. 
ALL TOO OFTEN, BECAUSE OF THE DISASTER, THE DEFAULT INFORMATIONSYSTEM IS EITHER SERIOUSLY JAMMED OR HAS EVEN BLACKED OUT COMPLETELY. 
THEREBY, DISASTERS MAY STRIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN, EITHER ON A PERSONAL OR ON COMMUNITY LEVEL.

FORTUNATELY, MANY PEOPLE ALREADY CARRY A POTENTIALLY POWERFULL HARDWARE INFORMATIONSYSTEM AROUND WITH THEM 24/7: THE HIGH-END SMARTPHONE, THAT NOWADAYS AND CERTAINLY IN THE FUTURE MORE AND MORE RESEMBLES THE POWER AND CAPACITY OF THAT OF A DESKTOP COMPUTER, BUT ALSO OFFERS EXTRA BUILT-IN COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.

IN SOME (POTENTIAL) EMERGENCY WE OFTEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL KINDS OF HIT-AND-RUN SITUATIONS THAT NEED IMMIDIATE ATTENTION AND ACTIONS.  

UNFORTUNATELY, THE PRESENT SOFTWARESYSTEM AND INFORMATION FRAMEWORK IS NOT BUILT TO REFLECT THESE NEEDS.

THE "CALAMITY JANE EXPRESS(R)" FRAMEWORK NOW, IS JUST TO BE MADE FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WHERE MOST OFTEN THREATS, CHAOS AND SCARCITY RULES. THIS (TO BE BUILT) HIT-AND-RUN PEER-TO-PEER FRAMEWORK IS TO OFFER DATA AND EVEN FUNCTIONALITY ON THE FLY (:FOTF).

IT'S BUILDING BLOCKS ACTUALLY ARE BASED ON EXISTING OPEN STANDARDS AND PROVEN TECHNOLOGY, JUST REARANGED A BIT. ALL INVOLVED (END-USER) DEVICES ARE OFF-THE-SHELF HARDWARE AND HAVE A WEB-BASED SOFTWARESYSTEM, A DEFAULT ON-BOARD PERSONAL PROXY SERVER AND A SO-CALLED BULLETED-USER-INTERFACE OR "BUI".

- OFF-THE-SHELF HARDWARE MEANS THAT NO SPECIAL (READ SCARCE AND/OR EXPENSIVE) TECHNOLOGY IS NEEDED.
- A WEB-BASED SOFTWARE-SYSTEM MEANS THAT ONE IS NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON A SPECIFIC OPERATING SYSTEM, JUST A W3-COMPLIANT BROWSER SUFFICES.
- A DEFAULT ON-BOARD PERSONAL PROXY SERVER MEANS THAT ONE CAN MAKE USE OF SOPHISTICATED SERVER-SIDE FRAMEWORKS WITH SOPHISTICATED PROCESSING, STORAGE AND SERVER-BASED PEER-TO-PEER COMMUNICATION.

-THE NEWLY (AND TO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED) BULLETED-USER-INTERFACE OR "BUI" NOW OFFERS THIS DEVICE'S SOPHISTICATED CAPABILITIES AS SIMPLE, UNIFORM AND FREELY RELOCATABLE "BULLETS" TO THE USER. THESE "BULLETS CAN REPRESENT ANYTHING, DATA OR FUNCTIONALITY, CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE, LOCAL OR REMOTE, AND CAN EASILY BE GROUPED, MIXED, DUPLICATED AND RELATED WITH EACH OTHER IN ANY WAY AT ANY TIME AND MAY WORK ON A COMMON CANVAS (IF ALLOWED SO BY THE USER). IN OTHER WORDS, DATA AND FUNCTIONS ARE NO LONGER LOCKED IN SOME FILE OR APPLICATION AT FOREHAND, BUT ARE COMPOSED ON THE FLY FROM A COLLECTION OF "OMNI-PRESENT NODES" INTO A "WEB OF DATA AND FUNCTIONALITY" (:WODAF).

JUST AS IT IS NEEDED IN AN (POTENTIAL) EMERGENCY SITUATION, ALTHOUGH THIS FRAMEWORK CAN ALSO BE USED IN NON-EMERGENCY SITUATIONS, BUT THEN IT OFFERS HUGE AGILITY, VERSATILITY, CUSTOMIZATION AND SCALABILITY COMPARED TO EXISTING LEGACY FRAMEWORKS.

A VERY SIMPLE INITIAL EXAMPLE (AS ALPHA-VERSION) CAN BE TRIED ONLINE (WITH SOME LIMITATIONS) AT WWW.CALAMITYJANEEXPRESS.NET OR CAN BE DOWNLOADED AS OPEN SOURCE FOR FURTHER DEVELOPEMNT AT GITHUB.COM/DEEJAYALEXANDER/CALAMITY-JANE-EXPRESS.
